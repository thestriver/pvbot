Pixel Vault has given holders 2 choices:burn the MintPass and receive a Generative; orhold onto it for the chance of winning one of 144 Cores, which are raffled out in groups of 12Burn vs. HoldAt first glance, it seems obvious that you should test your luck for a Core. However, PV doesn’t make it that easy. There have been a lot of benefits to holding a Generative:1 free Planet DAO token; dependent on the planetary origin of the Generative, which is randomly assigned at mint2 free MintPass #2 (1 for holding the Identity, and 1 for holding the free Planet)the option to stake for $POW, the in-game currency of the Inhabitants ecosystem. 20% of the 1 billion $POW tokens was set aside for those staking their Inhabitants Identitieseligibility to mint Gear Pods and participate in raffles as part of POWer Up Summer it's part of the Genesis Set​Just as with PUNKS Comic #1, PV forces collectors to make decisions based on their preferences and risk appetite, e.g.do you burn your MintPass to see if you’ll get a rare Generative, and the chance to claim a rarer planet?do you want the guaranteed benefits of having a Generative, or do you give those up for the chance at winning a Core?do you want to participate in POWer Up Summer to build your supply of Gear Pods and get the chance to win the MintPass #2 raffles?do you want to have a Genesis Set, and the potential perks that may come from it, or do you prefer the guaranteed rewards from having a Generative?and the game theory element - if more people are burning their MintPass #1, the odds of winning a Core increase, so do you continue to hold?OutcomeThere is no expiry date for when MintPass #1 can be burned for a Generative, so this game has been ongoing since since August 2021. It’s hard to know if/when it’ll end given the chance of winning a Core, and the potential rewards for holding a Genesis Set.The final Core raffle was completed on 21 Oct 2022.PreviousGamification of the Inhabitants UniverseNext - Learn About Pixel VaultMerch StoreLast modified 4mo agoCopy linkOn this pageBurn vs. HoldOutcome ",https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/learn/gamification/MHU/mintpass1

You can think of it as unopened trading card packs - you know there’s a trading card (or in our case, an NFT) inside, but you don’t know what it is until you open it.Prior to MintPasses, new launches of NFT projects were first-come, first-serve. This was problematic at the time because:to make transactions on a blockchain like Ethereum, users pay transaction fees (i.e. gas fees)while there’s a limit to the number of transactions which can be processed in each block, users can choose to pay extra for their transaction to be prioritisedfirst-come, first-serve NFT launches created a dynamic where users would choose to pay high amounts of fees in a rush to mint their NFT before the supply ran out, also known as a gas warGas wars favour those with the most capital, so Pixel Vault conceptualised the MintPass in July 2021 to enable more fair & equitable NFT drops. The concept was quick to be adopted by other teams and is now extremely common.Pixel Vault MintPasses include:​MintPass #1, the ticket to getting Inhabitants Identities​​MintPass #2, the ticket to getting DOTs​There were provided for free or at a low cost to existing holders of PV assets, as a reward for their support.PreviousSpeciesNextMintPass #1Last modified 4mo agoCopy link ",https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/learn/ecosystem/IU/mintpass

It'll be released in two sets:Set 1: Issues 1-8Set 2: Issues 9-16GamificationHere's how it works: Origin Stories Issue 1 was dedicated to the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO (PVFD), so the total supply was originally 5,902 (in line with the number of PVFD tokens)For Origin Stories Issues 2-8, each new issue can only be claimed by collectors who burn one of the previous issues, during a limited time window that's open until the release of the following issue. This means the total supply of all 8 Origin Stories Set 1 NFTs is 5,902. For example:When Issue 4 is released, all holders of Issues 1-3 are able to burn their NFTs to receive Issue 4. When Issue 5 is released, the claim for Issue 4 will be closed, and the maximum supply of Issue 4 will be set. From that point onwards, it'll be deflationary as it can be burnt for Issues 5-8Holders of the full Set 1 (Issues 1-8) will receive a physical premium bound copy of all 8 issuesCollectors have a lot of decisions to make:do they want to collect the full set of 8 to be eligible to receive the physical? Keep in mind, given the supply of Origin Stories Set 1 is fixed to 5,902, there can only be a maximum of 737 full sets, which makes the physical quite scarceif not, do they want to hold onto the issue they have, or burn to claim a new issue? What if there's a character or guest artist that they resonate with in the new issue?and the game theory - in each of the 7 burn windows, the supply of previous issues will be decreasing as they're burnt for the current issue.

Originally, Pixel Vault planned to allow multiple Gear Pod mints, with multiple sets of Nebula Gear Pod and MintPass 2 raffles. However, due to delays from organising the make-up mint, and a lack of clarity around what Gear Pods are for, POWer Up Summer ended after one set of raffles.On this page, you'll find:​context behind POWer Up Summer​details of the game mechanicsa timeline of events so far, to help you make sense of what's going onuseful resources​ContextHolders of MetaHero Identities had the option to stake for $POW over a 6-month period which ended on June 5, 2022. After this staking period ended, Pixel Vault launched POWer Up Summer to continue gamifying the experience of being a MetaHero Identity holder and to allow holders to prepare their MetaHeroes for the many games to come.In the context of the MetaHero Universe, POWer Up Summer is the beginning of a peace treaty between the MetaHeroes and DOTs, which gives MetaHeroes an opportunity to ""assemble a fleet of DOTs"" to ""promote interplanetary co-operation, expansion and discovery"".This leads to the DOTs distributing Gear Pods to MetaHeroes:What is a Gear Pod?Gear Pods are ""critical supplies"" that the DOTs are deploying to MetaHeroes to help them power up and explore the MetaHero Universe. The contents (gear) of the Gear Pods will be revealed when the Gear Pods are burned in-game. The rarity of the gear will vary with the different pods. There are 3 different types of pods:Astral Gear Pod - most commonCosmic Gear Pod - rarer than Astral, with planet-specific variations. All MetaHeroes will be able to use any gear, regardless of their planet of origin.Nebula Gear Pod - extremely rareGamificationThere are 3 key elements to POWer Up Summer. Here's how it works:1) Gear Pod mintingHolders of at least 1 MetaHero Identity AND at least 1 Planet are eligible to mint Gear Pods:What you need to know: each MetaHero Identity can be paired with up to 3 separate planet tokens, allowing holders to mint up to 3 Gear Pods per MetaHero held. There are 3 possible combinations:1 MetaHero + 1 mismatching, non-origin Planet = Astral Gear Pod1 MetaHero + 1 matching, origin Planet = Cosmic Gear Pod ({insert Planet})1 MetaHero + 1 Moon = Cosmic Gear Pod (Moon)each Gear Pod can be minted for 2000 $POW​A chart showing the 3 possible Metahero-Planet pairs (source)​2) Nebula Gear Pod distribution & rafflesNebula Gear Pods can't be minted, instead:1 Nebula Gear Pod will be given to collectors, for each of the following Pixel Vault assets they hold:​MetaHero Core Identity​​PUNKS Comic #1: Special Edition​​Planet DAO Set​holders of at least 1 Astral OR 1 Cosmic Gear Pod are entered into raffles to win Nebula Gear Pods.

It was founded in May 2021 by Sean Gearin (a.k.a GFunk). Since then, it has become one of the most ambitious companies in web3, looking to:redefine the future of storytelling, media & entertainment, gaming and sports; andbuild universes as big and as compelling as Disney and MarvelGFunk: ""Pixel Vault’s greatest differentiator is our team. Bull market or bear, we are a team of builders, relentlessly dedicated to telling great stories and embracing new technology for and alongside our community. We have never been more motivated than we are today."" (source: From the Desk: An Open Letter to the Pixel Vault Community)​To make sense of Pixel Vault:​understand how and why they do what they do ​get to know their history & key partnerships​​learn the core purpose and value of each individual asset within their ecosystem​​explore how everything fits together by diving into Pixel Vault's gamification of their ecosystem assets​The Pixel Vault rabbit hole is constantly getting deeper, so once you've done all that - check out What's On to stay up to speed.Understanding Pixel VaultThe Pixel Vault ecosystem is complicated. Because of that, it’s important to understand how PV thinks about building their products, and designing experiences.There are 3 aspects which make Pixel Vault, Pixel Vault.​they're committed to storytelling & empowering their fans to own and build alongside them​​a desire to make every step of the way fun for collectors​​they're relentlessly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with web3 tech ​Develop crypto-native IP assets, and tell their storiesPixel Vault's ambition is to build universes as big and as compelling as Disney and Marvel. They’re doing this through the power of storytelling, and across a broad range of channels. Think: comics, television, movies, video games, consumer goods, real-life experiences and much more. However, there’s one major difference between Pixel Vault & Disney: PV is building with web3 technologies & principles.GFunk: “We do not look at the fan as the customer. Our fans are the owner and the builder.” (source: Pixel Vault banks $100 million in funding to chase an NFT media empire)​To break that down:Fans as owners: PV develops “crypto-native IP assets” in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They wants their IP assets to be owned by their fans. That way, the success of PV in building a broad fan-base through the stories they tell and the media they create, is the fan’s success as well (as value accrues to the IP assets over time)Fans as builders: IP assets in traditional media companies are tightly protected. However, PV wants to build alongside their fans, rather than treating them as customers and passive consumers of their media. For example, PV will let their fans contribute to stories, and also give full commercial rights to owners of some of their IP assets. Since fans are owners, they’re incentivised to help build with PVGFunk: We’re an IP business leveraging next generation technologies. We’re still approaching IP in a way that’s very similar to what these legacy institutions are doing, but we’re doing it in a way that actually benefits the broader community. This collective mind of our community all working together to develop this IP is going to be tremendously disruptive to legacy institutions. You’ve seen Amazon and Netflix already disrupt what the traditional studios were doing, and I think this is the next logical progression of where that’s going. (source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)​Make web3 funOne thing Pixel Vault has become renowned for, is gamifying the collector experience. For the nitty-gritty details of this, check out the Gamification section. Otherwise, just know this:PV wants each person’s collection of their assets to reflect their own decisions - based on their unique personality, personal preferences and risk appetite. Being one of their collectors is like being a part of the game that is Pixel Vault, orchestrated by GFunk and his team.This all stems from GFunk’s desire to create an active, engaged and fun collector experience:GFunk: At the end of the day, NFTs should be fun. If it's not bringing a smile to your face, you're doing something wrong (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​It’s a lot of - do you do Option 1 because of X & Y, or Option 2 because of Z. In the first instance, it may seem like one option is clearly better. But then there’s the game theory element. What if more people go with Option 2, does Option 1 start to become preferable? And then what if Option 3 is unexpectedly introduced?!Also, PV is thinking more broadly than just the collector experience. They want to make participating in the web3 ecosystem more fun and easy in general, for example, by gamifying DAO participation to incentivise engagement.Build web3 idea legos​Packy McCormick, who writes Not Boring, talks about the concept of idea legos. He argues that in web3, every new experiment is a building block for the future; a lego piece that anyone can pick up and use. Even if the things being built look silly or stupid, everything helps to compound human knowledge, enabling us to build faster & potentially solve more and more complex problems.Pixel Vault are constantly building new idea legos which solve problems within the space, and push the boundaries of what’s possible using web3 tech. These legos not only enable PV themselves to build faster and create new experiences, but it helps the broader space too.

Originally, Pixel Vault planned to allow multiple Gear Pod mints, with multiple sets of Nebula Gear Pod and MintPass 2 raffles. However, due to delays from organising the make-up mint, and a lack of clarity around what Gear Pods are for, POWer Up Summer ended after one set of raffles.On this page, you'll find:​context behind POWer Up Summer​details of the game mechanicsa timeline of events so far, to help you make sense of what's going onuseful resources​ContextHolders of MetaHero Identities had the option to stake for $POW over a 6-month period which ended on June 5, 2022. After this staking period ended, Pixel Vault launched POWer Up Summer to continue gamifying the experience of being a MetaHero Identity holder and to allow holders to prepare their MetaHeroes for the many games to come.In the context of the MetaHero Universe, POWer Up Summer is the beginning of a peace treaty between the MetaHeroes and DOTs, which gives MetaHeroes an opportunity to ""assemble a fleet of DOTs"" to ""promote interplanetary co-operation, expansion and discovery"".This leads to the DOTs distributing Gear Pods to MetaHeroes:What is a Gear Pod?Gear Pods are ""critical supplies"" that the DOTs are deploying to MetaHeroes to help them power up and explore the MetaHero Universe. The contents (gear) of the Gear Pods will be revealed when the Gear Pods are burned in-game. The rarity of the gear will vary with the different pods. There are 3 different types of pods:Astral Gear Pod - most commonCosmic Gear Pod - rarer than Astral, with planet-specific variations.

Collectors have had the choice to:​Stake for $PUNKS tokens, representing proportional ownership of CryptoPunks​​Burn for access to the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO or Moon DAO​Stake for $PUNKSPUNKS Comic #1 enables holders to gain proportional ownership over the 16 CryptoPunks which inspired the PUNKS characters. Here’s how it works:the 16 CryptoPunks were locked into a vault via the platform Fractional​Fractional created 100,000,000 $PUNKS tokens to represent ownership of the 16 CryptoPunks in the vault.PUNKS Comic #1 holders can stake (i.e. lock away) their comic over 2 years to earn $PUNKS tokensBurn for DAOsPUNKS Comic #1 was the key to two of Pixel Vault’s most exclusive DAOs: the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO (PVFD) and the Moon DAO.To receive either of those DAO tokens, holders needed to burn their PUNKS Comic #1. This means permanently removing the comic token from the available supply, and giving up the option to stake it for $PUNKS tokens, as well as the right to claim a physical copy.Collectors had to decide for themselves what they valued most, e.g.did they care most about the comic, for its value as a collectible (as an NFT & as a physical comic) and the ability to gain fractional ownership over the 16 CryptoPunks?did they want to be part of the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO, for ownership over the vault of assets, exposure to everything PV creates, and the chance to hang out, and build with all the other passionate Pixel Vault fans?or were they more excited by the MetaHero gaming platform, and the opportunity to be part of one of its most exclusive and influential DAOs?and the game theory - if more are burning for PVFD or Moon DAO, does that make Comic #1 more valuable, given the $PUNKS earning rate increases and the comic becomes more scarce?OutcomeThe original 10,000 supply of PUNKS Comic #1 has fallen to 3371. Alongside it are now 5902 PVFD tokens, and 710 Moon DAO tokens.Fun Fact #1: if you do the math, 3371 + 5902 + 710 = 9,983. Here’s what happened to the missing 17.Fun Fact #2: Bad actors exploited a vulnerability which let them burn PUNKS Comic #1 NFTs that they didn’t own, and receive Moon DAO tokens. 58 comics were affected. In response, Pixel Vault compensated those affected with a Special Edition Comic #1, and re-issued the Moon DAO tokens. The exploited Moon DAO is now called The Dark Moon.

Collectors have had the choice to:​Stake for $PUNKS tokens, representing proportional ownership of CryptoPunks​​Burn for access to the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO or Moon DAO​Stake for $PUNKSPUNKS Comic #1 enables holders to gain proportional ownership over the 16 CryptoPunks which inspired the PUNKS characters. Here’s how it works:the 16 CryptoPunks were locked into a vault via the platform Fractional​Fractional created 100,000,000 $PUNKS tokens to represent ownership of the 16 CryptoPunks in the vault.PUNKS Comic #1 holders can stake (i.e. lock away) their comic over 2 years to earn $PUNKS tokensBurn for DAOsPUNKS Comic #1 was the key to two of Pixel Vault’s most exclusive DAOs: the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO (PVFD) and the Moon DAO.To receive either of those DAO tokens, holders needed to burn their PUNKS Comic #1. This means permanently removing the comic token from the available supply, and giving up the option to stake it for $PUNKS tokens, as well as the right to claim a physical copy.Collectors had to decide for themselves what they valued most, e.g.did they care most about the comic, for its value as a collectible (as an NFT & as a physical comic) and the ability to gain fractional ownership over the 16 CryptoPunks?did they want to be part of the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO, for ownership over the vault of assets, exposure to everything PV creates, and the chance to hang out, and build with all the other passionate Pixel Vault fans?or were they more excited by the MetaHero gaming platform, and the opportunity to be part of one of its most exclusive and influential DAOs?and the game theory - if more are burning for PVFD or Moon DAO, does that make Comic #1 more valuable, given the $PUNKS earning rate increases and the comic becomes more scarce?OutcomeThe original 10,000 supply of PUNKS Comic #1 has fallen to 3371. Alongside it are now 5902 PVFD tokens, and 710 Moon DAO tokens.Fun Fact #1: if you do the math, 3371 + 5902 + 710 = 9,983. Here’s what happened to the missing 17.Fun Fact #2: Bad actors exploited a vulnerability which let them burn PUNKS Comic #1 NFTs that they didn’t own, and receive Moon DAO tokens. 58 comics were affected. In response, Pixel Vault compensated those affected with a Special Edition Comic #1, and re-issued the Moon DAO tokens. The exploited Moon DAO is now called The Dark Moon.

Beanie invested the capital that Pixel Vault needed to launch, and offered up 13 of his own CryptoPunks. For more, read Pixel Vault's Origin Story. Beanie’s ties to PV was a double-edged sword:on one hand, Pixel Vault wouldn’t have been able to launch without his initial investment. With his large following, he was able to spread the word about PV, and draw a lot of attention to the project; especially with his infamous leaks of the PV roadmap.on the other hand, he was a controversial figure; respected by some who made money following him, and hated by others who saw him to be quite provocative and misleading. On 17 January 2022, a thread was published by @NFTethics, suggesting that Beanie was involved in a series of scams.GFunk responded the following day, announcing PV’s separation from Beanie, which had already been in the works for months. The separation would see all of Beanie’s PV assets returned to PV.However, the drama didn’t end there. Some questioned why Beanie was receiving royalties from sales of PV assets, and whether Beanie was in fact the one in charge at PV, rather than GFunk.To summarise GFunk’s response:Pixel Vault was GFunk’s idea, and he ran the business from the very beginningBeanie put up the capital & NFT assets to bring Pixel Vault to life, when no-one else was willing to, and therefore he was entitled to some of PV revenuesMoving forward, Beanie has no involvement with PV; he’ll hold no assets and earn no royaltiesFun Fact: Beanie's own CryptoPunk is one of the 16 PUNKS. Because of this, the Beanie character appears throughout PUNKS Comic #1 and #2. However in #3, Beanie's character enters a portal with the PUNKS crew, literally turns into a bean and then gets thrown back into the portal. Perhaps that's the last we see of his character?Taken from PUNKS Comic 3 (source)​​PreviousPixel Vault's Origin StoryNextPartnershipsLast modified 8mo agoCopy link ",https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/learn/history/beanie

It was founded in May 2021 by Sean Gearin (a.k.a GFunk). Since then, it has become one of the most ambitious companies in web3, looking to:redefine the future of storytelling, media & entertainment, gaming and sports; andbuild universes as big and as compelling as Disney and MarvelGFunk: ""Pixel Vault’s greatest differentiator is our team. Bull market or bear, we are a team of builders, relentlessly dedicated to telling great stories and embracing new technology for and alongside our community. We have never been more motivated than we are today."" (source: From the Desk: An Open Letter to the Pixel Vault Community)​To make sense of Pixel Vault:​understand how and why they do what they do ​get to know their history & key partnerships​​learn the core purpose and value of each individual asset within their ecosystem​​explore how everything fits together by diving into Pixel Vault's gamification of their ecosystem assets​The Pixel Vault rabbit hole is constantly getting deeper, so once you've done all that - check out What's On to stay up to speed.Understanding Pixel VaultThe Pixel Vault ecosystem is complicated. Because of that, it’s important to understand how PV thinks about building their products, and designing experiences.There are 3 aspects which make Pixel Vault, Pixel Vault.​they're committed to storytelling & empowering their fans to own and build alongside them​​a desire to make every step of the way fun for collectors​​they're relentlessly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with web3 tech ​Develop crypto-native IP assets, and tell their storiesPixel Vault's ambition is to build universes as big and as compelling as Disney and Marvel. They’re doing this through the power of storytelling, and across a broad range of channels. Think: comics, television, movies, video games, consumer goods, real-life experiences and much more. However, there’s one major difference between Pixel Vault & Disney: PV is building with web3 technologies & principles.GFunk: “We do not look at the fan as the customer. Our fans are the owner and the builder.” (source: Pixel Vault banks $100 million in funding to chase an NFT media empire)​To break that down:Fans as owners: PV develops “crypto-native IP assets” in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They wants their IP assets to be owned by their fans. That way, the success of PV in building a broad fan-base through the stories they tell and the media they create, is the fan’s success as well (as value accrues to the IP assets over time)Fans as builders: IP assets in traditional media companies are tightly protected. However, PV wants to build alongside their fans, rather than treating them as customers and passive consumers of their media. For example, PV will let their fans contribute to stories, and also give full commercial rights to owners of some of their IP assets. Since fans are owners, they’re incentivised to help build with PVGFunk: We’re an IP business leveraging next generation technologies. We’re still approaching IP in a way that’s very similar to what these legacy institutions are doing, but we’re doing it in a way that actually benefits the broader community. This collective mind of our community all working together to develop this IP is going to be tremendously disruptive to legacy institutions. You’ve seen Amazon and Netflix already disrupt what the traditional studios were doing, and I think this is the next logical progression of where that’s going. (source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)​Make web3 funOne thing Pixel Vault has become renowned for, is gamifying the collector experience. For the nitty-gritty details of this, check out the Gamification section. Otherwise, just know this:PV wants each person’s collection of their assets to reflect their own decisions - based on their unique personality, personal preferences and risk appetite. Being one of their collectors is like being a part of the game that is Pixel Vault, orchestrated by GFunk and his team.This all stems from GFunk’s desire to create an active, engaged and fun collector experience:GFunk: At the end of the day, NFTs should be fun. If it's not bringing a smile to your face, you're doing something wrong (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​It’s a lot of - do you do Option 1 because of X & Y, or Option 2 because of Z. In the first instance, it may seem like one option is clearly better. But then there’s the game theory element. What if more people go with Option 2, does Option 1 start to become preferable? And then what if Option 3 is unexpectedly introduced?!Also, PV is thinking more broadly than just the collector experience. They want to make participating in the web3 ecosystem more fun and easy in general, for example, by gamifying DAO participation to incentivise engagement.Build web3 idea legos​Packy McCormick, who writes Not Boring, talks about the concept of idea legos. He argues that in web3, every new experiment is a building block for the future; a lego piece that anyone can pick up and use. Even if the things being built look silly or stupid, everything helps to compound human knowledge, enabling us to build faster & potentially solve more and more complex problems.Pixel Vault are constantly building new idea legos which solve problems within the space, and push the boundaries of what’s possible using web3 tech. These legos not only enable PV themselves to build faster and create new experiences, but it helps the broader space too.

It'll be released in two sets:Set 1: Issues 1-8Set 2: Issues 9-16GamificationHere's how it works: Origin Stories Issue 1 was dedicated to the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO (PVFD), so the total supply was originally 5,902 (in line with the number of PVFD tokens)For Origin Stories Issues 2-8, each new issue can only be claimed by collectors who burn one of the previous issues, during a limited time window that's open until the release of the following issue. This means the total supply of all 8 Origin Stories Set 1 NFTs is 5,902. For example:When Issue 4 is released, all holders of Issues 1-3 are able to burn their NFTs to receive Issue 4. When Issue 5 is released, the claim for Issue 4 will be closed, and the maximum supply of Issue 4 will be set. From that point onwards, it'll be deflationary as it can be burnt for Issues 5-8Holders of the full Set 1 (Issues 1-8) will receive a physical premium bound copy of all 8 issuesCollectors have a lot of decisions to make:do they want to collect the full set of 8 to be eligible to receive the physical? Keep in mind, given the supply of Origin Stories Set 1 is fixed to 5,902, there can only be a maximum of 737 full sets, which makes the physical quite scarceif not, do they want to hold onto the issue they have, or burn to claim a new issue? What if there's a character or guest artist that they resonate with in the new issue?and the game theory - in each of the 7 burn windows, the supply of previous issues will be decreasing as they're burnt for the current issue.

After this staking period ended, Pixel Vault launched POWer Up Summer to continue gamifying the experience of being a MetaHero Identity holder and to allow holders to prepare their MetaHeroes for the many games to come.In the context of the MetaHero Universe, POWer Up Summer is the beginning of a peace treaty between the MetaHeroes and DOTs, which gives MetaHeroes an opportunity to ""assemble a fleet of DOTs"" to ""promote interplanetary co-operation, expansion and discovery"".This leads to the DOTs distributing Gear Pods to MetaHeroes:What is a Gear Pod?Gear Pods are ""critical supplies"" that the DOTs are deploying to MetaHeroes to help them power up and explore the MetaHero Universe.

Originally, Pixel Vault planned to allow multiple Gear Pod mints, with multiple sets of Nebula Gear Pod and MintPass 2 raffles. However, due to delays from organising the make-up mint, and a lack of clarity around what Gear Pods are for, POWer Up Summer ended after one set of raffles.On this page, you'll find:​context behind POWer Up Summer​details of the game mechanicsa timeline of events so far, to help you make sense of what's going onuseful resources​ContextHolders of MetaHero Identities had the option to stake for $POW over a 6-month period which ended on June 5, 2022. After this staking period ended, Pixel Vault launched POWer Up Summer to continue gamifying the experience of being a MetaHero Identity holder and to allow holders to prepare their MetaHeroes for the many games to come.In the context of the MetaHero Universe, POWer Up Summer is the beginning of a peace treaty between the MetaHeroes and DOTs, which gives MetaHeroes an opportunity to ""assemble a fleet of DOTs"" to ""promote interplanetary co-operation, expansion and discovery"".This leads to the DOTs distributing Gear Pods to MetaHeroes:What is a Gear Pod?Gear Pods are ""critical supplies"" that the DOTs are deploying to MetaHeroes to help them power up and explore the MetaHero Universe. The contents (gear) of the Gear Pods will be revealed when the Gear Pods are burned in-game. The rarity of the gear will vary with the different pods. There are 3 different types of pods:Astral Gear Pod - most commonCosmic Gear Pod - rarer than Astral, with planet-specific variations. All MetaHeroes will be able to use any gear, regardless of their planet of origin.Nebula Gear Pod - extremely rareGamificationThere are 3 key elements to POWer Up Summer. Here's how it works:1) Gear Pod mintingHolders of at least 1 MetaHero Identity AND at least 1 Planet are eligible to mint Gear Pods:What you need to know: each MetaHero Identity can be paired with up to 3 separate planet tokens, allowing holders to mint up to 3 Gear Pods per MetaHero held. There are 3 possible combinations:1 MetaHero + 1 mismatching, non-origin Planet = Astral Gear Pod1 MetaHero + 1 matching, origin Planet = Cosmic Gear Pod ({insert Planet})1 MetaHero + 1 Moon = Cosmic Gear Pod (Moon)each Gear Pod can be minted for 2000 $POW​A chart showing the 3 possible Metahero-Planet pairs (source)​2) Nebula Gear Pod distribution & rafflesNebula Gear Pods can't be minted, instead:1 Nebula Gear Pod will be given to collectors, for each of the following Pixel Vault assets they hold:​MetaHero Core Identity​​PUNKS Comic #1: Special Edition​​Planet DAO Set​holders of at least 1 Astral OR 1 Cosmic Gear Pod are entered into raffles to win Nebula Gear Pods.

For more info, read through the official documentation here.On this page, you'll find:​context behind the UPDAO Voting Dashboard (a.k.a PRISM)details of the beta testing​details of the launch of PRISM​ContextWhat is the United Planets DAO (UPDAO)?The UPDAO is like the Federal Government or United Nations of the Inhabits Universe. It’s where every Planet comes together to make decisions on behalf of the Universe as a whole. Each planet has a fixed amount of voting power within the UPDAO.Pixel Vault's ambition is to turn the Inhabitants Universe into a decentralised gaming platform owned and governed by fans. A core part of this are the planets, as each planet token represents proportional ownership and voting power in the specific planet. Together, the 10 planets/DAOs make decisions in the broader UPDAO.To enable this experience, Pixel Vault has to:create a voting experience which allows the DAOs (planets + UPDAO) to interact with each othercreate an intuitive user experience which makes DAO participation fun & easy, especially given collectors can be part of multiple DAOs (i.e. owning multiple planet tokens)To do this, Pixel Vault has been building a custom UPDAO voting dashboard called Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (PRISM).Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (“PRISM”) is a forum and voting hub for Planet token holders. It’s also home to all the information one might need when learning about the UPDAO. PRISM offers a streamlined UI/UX for collectors to seamlessly make decisions for 10 planetary DAOs and the overarching UPDAO. Pixel Vault built PRISM because the current tools for DAO participation are bifurcated, and results in decreased participation by DAO members. PRISM implements discussion into the voting mechanics, eliminating the need for two separate apps. PRISM has been designed to make governance intuitive and fun for broad audiences (hint: certain UPDAO participation may translate directly to future gaming outcomes). (source: Reimagining DAOs — How Pixel Vault Simplified the Complex)​Beta TestingPrior to launch, beta testing of PRISM was previously open to holders of at least 1 planet. Testers had the opportunity to share their thoughts/ideas/feedback, and had the chance to receive $POW rewards for their contributions.Original AnnouncementAttention, all inhabitants of the planetary ecosystem! We are initiating our search for bright,active minds and strong contributors across the solar system to help lay the foundation for interplanetary governance and cooperation. The system’s best are being asked to come review the planetary referendum and sustainability machine, errr PRISM, for any weaknesses and flaws in our systems. To provide the optimal experience, we must have a variety of perspectives: from those who have curated whole planet sets to those concerned citizens holding a singular planet. Dedication to the UPDAO will be rewarded (did someone say $POW…), and there will be glory—your contributions at this critical juncture will never be forgotten by the United Planets. To qualify for these bounties, you must be:Holding 1+ planet(s)Eager to participate by sharing your thoughts and ideas, as well as weighing in on others’ ideas, thoughtfullyOpen to providing feedback - for the galactic governance platform and to the UPDAO as a whole! Note: Planet holders that have a complete planet set and/or PVFD will be prioritized. Once selected, you will be contacted by our mission leader for further instruction.

This led to him starting his career as a Legal Intern at Warner Bros in 2013. After that, GFunk co-founded Qruber Virtual Production Office, a collaboration and workflow management tool for film and television productions. Later, he became the VP of Business Development for Indiepay, an accounting software for production teams. In his final role before founding PV, he was the Head of Growth at Syfer, a cybersecurity company.In terms of his crypto journey, GFunk has been around the space since 2014.Back then, any profits he made were used to support his real world businesses. Towards the end of 2020, he discovered non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through NBA Top Shot. What are non-fungible tokens (NFTs)?NFTs are a way for us to represent digital assets, so that we can own things on the internet. With NFTs, we can verify:ownership: who owns a digital asset?authenticity: do they own the real thing?Having grown up collecting sports cards, he could see the potential of NFTs in enabling the ownership of digital assets. He quickly fell down the NFT rabbithole; making money flipping projects like Hashmasks, collecting digital and generative art like on Art Blocks, and finding himself welcomed by the CryptoPunks community.What are CryptoPunks?CryptoPunks are a collection of 10,000 pixelated characters and one of the early NFT collections. They’re widely seen as being historically significant for their role in igniting the popularity and growth of NFTs. For more on this and a backstory of the CryptoPunks, Sandra Upson’s piece ‘The 10,000 Faces That Launched an NFT Revolution’ is a great read.At that point in time, early in 2021, GFunk noticed many individuals developing brands with their CryptoPunks, like @ClaireSilver12, @punk4156 and @gmoneyNFT . However, with his background in the entertainment industry, he realised no-one was developing intellectual property (IP) behind NFTs in the traditional sense, i.e. by crafting narrative and stories.The question he asked was: GFunk: “What if we could create a narrative behind these stagnant on-chain assets, that drove value beyond the collectability standpoint?” (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​And just like that, the concept of Pixel Vault was born.The birth of Pixel VaultTo start, GFunk teamed up with Preston Johnson a.k.a. SportsCheetah. They had their targets set on building stories around CryptoPunks. But there was one big problem; a lack of capital.The original Pixel Vault logoAfter reaching out to many crypto & NFT influencers/investors, GFunk managed to form a partnership with Beanie. Beanie invested the capital that Pixel Vault needed to launch, and offered up 13 of his own CryptoPunks. Meanwhile, GFunk and SportsCheetah were able to pull together 3 of their own. Without Beanie’s investment, Pixel Vault wouldn’t have been able to launch.The 16 CryptoPunks which started Pixel Vault (source)​With these 16 CryptoPunks to work with, Pixel Vault launched their first NFT collection on May 10 2021: PUNKS Comic Issue #1. They created characters inspired by the look of the 16 CryptoPunks, and brought them to life through a comic. It took 5 weeks to sell out the 10,000 comics, generating 2,000 ETH in sales.Examples of how PV transformed the CryptoPunks into characters. From left to right: Courtney (Punk #2146), The Futurist (Punk #9723), GFunk (Punk #1288) and Hilary (Punk #2041) (source)​For GFunk, selling out was a big deal. He’s openly shared the fact that he borrowed money from his mum, stepdad and friends.GFunk: “I was all in with everything I owned and then some, to launch this project. My whole life was on the line with that comic” (source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)​Learn About Pixel Vault - PreviousHistoryNextSeparation from BeanieLast modified 8mo agoCopy linkOn this pageGFunk meets NFTsThe birth of Pixel Vault ",https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/learn/history/pv-origins

After all, that was how Pixel Vault came to be - by telling the stories behind CryptoPunks. It's through stories that we'll get to know more about the Inhabitants Universe. How did the world come to be? Who are the Identities? What challenges do they face? What role do the DOTs play? What is life like on the different planets? In Aug 2022, Pixel Vault shared that: ""Another extraordinary comic artist, also of Marvel pedigree, will bring the upcoming MetaHero comics to life. Comics will be available to view online, open to all, and they will introduce characters, lore and stories.

For more info, read through the official documentation here.On this page, you'll find:​context behind the UPDAO Voting Dashboard (a.k.a PRISM)details of the beta testing​details of the launch of PRISM​ContextWhat is the United Planets DAO (UPDAO)?The UPDAO is like the Federal Government or United Nations of the Inhabits Universe. It’s where every Planet comes together to make decisions on behalf of the Universe as a whole. Each planet has a fixed amount of voting power within the UPDAO.Pixel Vault's ambition is to turn the Inhabitants Universe into a decentralised gaming platform owned and governed by fans. A core part of this are the planets, as each planet token represents proportional ownership and voting power in the specific planet. Together, the 10 planets/DAOs make decisions in the broader UPDAO.To enable this experience, Pixel Vault has to:create a voting experience which allows the DAOs (planets + UPDAO) to interact with each othercreate an intuitive user experience which makes DAO participation fun & easy, especially given collectors can be part of multiple DAOs (i.e. owning multiple planet tokens)To do this, Pixel Vault has been building a custom UPDAO voting dashboard called Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (PRISM).Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (“PRISM”) is a forum and voting hub for Planet token holders. It’s also home to all the information one might need when learning about the UPDAO. PRISM offers a streamlined UI/UX for collectors to seamlessly make decisions for 10 planetary DAOs and the overarching UPDAO. Pixel Vault built PRISM because the current tools for DAO participation are bifurcated, and results in decreased participation by DAO members. PRISM implements discussion into the voting mechanics, eliminating the need for two separate apps. PRISM has been designed to make governance intuitive and fun for broad audiences (hint: certain UPDAO participation may translate directly to future gaming outcomes). (source: Reimagining DAOs — How Pixel Vault Simplified the Complex)​Beta TestingPrior to launch, beta testing of PRISM was previously open to holders of at least 1 planet. Testers had the opportunity to share their thoughts/ideas/feedback, and had the chance to receive $POW rewards for their contributions.Original AnnouncementAttention, all inhabitants of the planetary ecosystem! We are initiating our search for bright,active minds and strong contributors across the solar system to help lay the foundation for interplanetary governance and cooperation. The system’s best are being asked to come review the planetary referendum and sustainability machine, errr PRISM, for any weaknesses and flaws in our systems. To provide the optimal experience, we must have a variety of perspectives: from those who have curated whole planet sets to those concerned citizens holding a singular planet.

And so the idea is to have staged small group play tests, we’ll probably reach out to the core committee first as a first round of play testers and then expand from there. Each iteration we’ll be improving game balance, sort of like the look and feel of it. Bugs are definitely a piece of it, but really the focus is going to be on making sure the game is fun and balanced and fair before we roll it out to the larger community."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022) High Level NewsPixel Vault are working towards creating a AAA Gaming Experience for the MetaHero Universe:""In partnership with a global, indie studio focused on the future of AAA games, we are working to bring the MetaHero Universe to life within an immersive 3D environment within the next year.""

(source: 10 Questions for GFunk)​Game #1) MetaHero Universe 3v3 auto-brawlerThe first iteration of the MetaHero Universe game will be a browser-based 3v3 auto-brawler:""We've been working on prototypes for games for Pixel Vault for a few months. One of the things that came out of that process was a battler. I'm a strategic game player. It's the idea of converting the fast twitch play you get with a League of Legends type game, and turning it into more of a strategic affair. You get to watch cool video game action but really what you're doing is making strategic choices around a game economy. We zeroed in on doing all the strategic stuff but having the fights look like superheroes going to town on each other. I don't see another game that blends those genres."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""We’re also inviting other projects to throw down in the auto brawler so there’ll be some seasons where we feature other IP which will be interesting – seeing how you match up against other known projects as well as other projects that PV will be releasing in the future. The idea is to create not just a PV brawler, but a web3 brawler that anyone can battle in."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)""We’re going to do it all browser based. So you don’t need to buy any rig or anything like that. As soon as we get the auto-brawler out, the next plan is to try and get it on to mobile devices."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identity holders will be able to play with their Identities, or draft them (i.e. let other people pay to use it)""Of course, you can play with your own MetaHeroes, because that's awesome and you should get special privileges. But if you choose to, you can park your MetaHero and let people pay you to use it. That's the seed of the idea. It'll be a little more interesting because you still have game theoretic choices when you put your MetaHero up for draft that affect how appealing they are to choose from. You'll be competing against other MetaHeroes to get the intention of people who are using $POW to play the game. It's going to create an interesting marketplace dynamic around MetaHero traits."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""The way that it’s going to work is when you’re playing in tournament mode, there’s an entry fee to start and then you have a bunch of strategic choices to make. The first most important one is how you want to assemble your team. If you have MetaHeroes, it saves you choices that you can make on other things in the game, like which powers you want to use, or how many powers you want to equip in your first round. And so having MetaHeroes gives you more flexibility in the options that you have, but you still need a full team of three to play."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identities will have powers related to their traits, but in addition, another collectible asset will be introduced to represent powers that can be used for battle""Each MetaHero will have powers relative to their attributes. When we launch the game, we'll start with a few attributes. They will be unique powers that only MetaHeroes have. Eventually, I want to have them for as many attributes as makes sense. By virtue of those attributes, the MetaHeroes will automatically get them during battle. In addition, we'll introduce another asset that represents powers that can be used - not by any MetaHero - cos there's planets and certain specialities of MetaHeroes. It's a little like a collectible card game. If I don't have a MetaHero, I can collect these powers and apply them to MetaHeroes as appropriate, as they're available for draft, as they go into battle. My strategic decisions are: what powers do I have? Which MetaHeroes do they match up with the best? Which planets will I be fighting on? What do I know about my opponents?"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""They’ll start as a layer 2 NFT and then as you play with them and use the NFT more and more and level up your hero, level up the superpower itself, you have the opportunity to convert it over to a mainnet asset. And so the idea is to not dilute mainnet NFTs by making it very hard and skill based for which superpowers actually ultimately make it there."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​Gear Pods are re-usable and will be a constant source of goodies, with a risk/rewards element""There's a special spot in my heart for gear pods. I'm not going to give away many details. You'll be able to open your gear pod. There’ll be stuff you can use in this game for it. We are in the process of making multiple games. I’m not making a single game, I’m making a platform for many games. I want this game to represent the first game in a long series of games that PV will be responsible for. But that also opens up a pathway where other partners and communities can get involved. Gear pods are going to be essential to that. There’ll be a gamified opening - when you can open it, you’ll get what’s inside, then they'll close and you'll have the opportunity to recharge them. There'll be a little mini game - like a gamified aspect to it, where there's risk and rewards to opening it, every time you open it. It'll be a constant source of goodies depending on how you play that game."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​Planet tokens can be staked to earn rewards and planet holders will be able to participate in their own mini games""There’s a couple different pathways for planet holders. You will get matched up against teams. Sometimes you’ll know which teams/planets you get matched up against, sometimes you won't. The planets you end up playing on – if you have staked your planet token - the planets will have a participatory game mechanic similar to MetaHeroes where they can earn rewards for participating through staking. The winner has to play some portion of winning rewards to the planet for hosting. That's a piece of it but there's actually a lot more. There's a whole other almost mini game for planet holders which will determine how big of a reward, how often the planet shows up for battle, and how much of a bonus MH from that planet will get when they fight on that planet"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​$POW will be instrumental to the game & gaming ecosystem$POW will be instrument for playing the game. One of my hopes is that we’ll get people outside the community interested in $POW because they want to play the game. It’s instrumentally important to this protocol that we teased in the video. (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)Those without PV assets will still be able to play""The game is designed to have different modes and tiers, largely in part due to the accessibility question. Want it to be easy for people to get into the game, play it, get a feel for it. They may not get as much out of it as they could - it’s so much funner if you really get into the community if you know what I mean - and if you’re in the community then it’s a different game. There'll be different challenges available to you. We want a pathway for people outside the community to get in, and special perks for those in the community."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)The grand ambition for Pixel Vault is to build a decentralised gaming protocol, which any developer can adopt to distribute, monetise, promote and publish games.""I didn't come to Pixel Vault to make a single game or even a bunch of games. The most important thing to have an ecosystem based around games that is completely decentralised. If anyone has developed games before, they know the market for games is ridiculously competitive. My theory is that it's due to these centralised platforms. What PV is incubating - that I'm most excited about - is to act as a flagship title for demonstrating the features of this completely decentralised platform for distributing, monetising, promoting games and publishing games. That's the idea behind this protocol. We're working with a team that's building it. We're releasing it as an open protocol that any developer can adopt. The game is the cherry on top of this huge cake that'll change the way games are made forever in my mind.""

For those of you unfamiliar with their work, I would suggest watching their company reel or “Love, Death, & Robots” on Netflix. With their help, we are ready to raise the bar for what content coming from web3 can look/feel/sound like.We are underway with character redesign and hard at work on the design of the *highly complex* “Sidekicks” project. Given the co-dependency of the short-form content we are making alongside Blur, we are taking great care to make sure that the NFTs and animated series are telling a consistent story. In addition to the consistency of design assets, we are working on world-building and the development of scripts to ultimately tell the stories of the MetaHero Universe in a manner inspired by Love, Death, & Robots — shorter form and open to many different artistic interpretations.For those familiar with premium content development cycles, we expect the longer form content to take quite some time — about a year based on our more aggressive goals — but we will be releasing teasers, concept art, and keeping the community engaged along the way. Both Blur and Pixel Vault believe in letting the work speak for itself — if something is of the highest caliber, there is no need for empty hype. We want the work to do the talking.

Originally, Pixel Vault planned to allow multiple Gear Pod mints, with multiple sets of Nebula Gear Pod and MintPass 2 raffles. However, due to delays from organising the make-up mint, and a lack of clarity around what Gear Pods are for, POWer Up Summer ended after one set of raffles.On this page, you'll find:​context behind POWer Up Summer​details of the game mechanicsa timeline of events so far, to help you make sense of what's going onuseful resources​ContextHolders of MetaHero Identities had the option to stake for $POW over a 6-month period which ended on June 5, 2022. After this staking period ended, Pixel Vault launched POWer Up Summer to continue gamifying the experience of being a MetaHero Identity holder and to allow holders to prepare their MetaHeroes for the many games to come.In the context of the MetaHero Universe, POWer Up Summer is the beginning of a peace treaty between the MetaHeroes and DOTs, which gives MetaHeroes an opportunity to ""assemble a fleet of DOTs"" to ""promote interplanetary co-operation, expansion and discovery"".This leads to the DOTs distributing Gear Pods to MetaHeroes:What is a Gear Pod?Gear Pods are ""critical supplies"" that the DOTs are deploying to MetaHeroes to help them power up and explore the MetaHero Universe. The contents (gear) of the Gear Pods will be revealed when the Gear Pods are burned in-game. The rarity of the gear will vary with the different pods. There are 3 different types of pods:Astral Gear Pod - most commonCosmic Gear Pod - rarer than Astral, with planet-specific variations. All MetaHeroes will be able to use any gear, regardless of their planet of origin.Nebula Gear Pod - extremely rareGamificationThere are 3 key elements to POWer Up Summer. Here's how it works:1) Gear Pod mintingHolders of at least 1 MetaHero Identity AND at least 1 Planet are eligible to mint Gear Pods:What you need to know: each MetaHero Identity can be paired with up to 3 separate planet tokens, allowing holders to mint up to 3 Gear Pods per MetaHero held. There are 3 possible combinations:1 MetaHero + 1 mismatching, non-origin Planet = Astral Gear Pod1 MetaHero + 1 matching, origin Planet = Cosmic Gear Pod ({insert Planet})1 MetaHero + 1 Moon = Cosmic Gear Pod (Moon)each Gear Pod can be minted for 2000 $POW​A chart showing the 3 possible Metahero-Planet pairs (source)​2) Nebula Gear Pod distribution & rafflesNebula Gear Pods can't be minted, instead:1 Nebula Gear Pod will be given to collectors, for each of the following Pixel Vault assets they hold:​MetaHero Core Identity​​PUNKS Comic #1: Special Edition​​Planet DAO Set​holders of at least 1 Astral OR 1 Cosmic Gear Pod are entered into raffles to win Nebula Gear Pods.

For more info, read through the official documentation here.On this page, you'll find:​context behind the UPDAO Voting Dashboard (a.k.a PRISM)details of the beta testing​details of the launch of PRISM​ContextWhat is the United Planets DAO (UPDAO)?The UPDAO is like the Federal Government or United Nations of the Inhabits Universe. It’s where every Planet comes together to make decisions on behalf of the Universe as a whole. Each planet has a fixed amount of voting power within the UPDAO.Pixel Vault's ambition is to turn the Inhabitants Universe into a decentralised gaming platform owned and governed by fans. A core part of this are the planets, as each planet token represents proportional ownership and voting power in the specific planet. Together, the 10 planets/DAOs make decisions in the broader UPDAO.To enable this experience, Pixel Vault has to:create a voting experience which allows the DAOs (planets + UPDAO) to interact with each othercreate an intuitive user experience which makes DAO participation fun & easy, especially given collectors can be part of multiple DAOs (i.e. owning multiple planet tokens)To do this, Pixel Vault has been building a custom UPDAO voting dashboard called Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (PRISM).Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (“PRISM”) is a forum and voting hub for Planet token holders. It’s also home to all the information one might need when learning about the UPDAO. PRISM offers a streamlined UI/UX for collectors to seamlessly make decisions for 10 planetary DAOs and the overarching UPDAO. Pixel Vault built PRISM because the current tools for DAO participation are bifurcated, and results in decreased participation by DAO members. PRISM implements discussion into the voting mechanics, eliminating the need for two separate apps. PRISM has been designed to make governance intuitive and fun for broad audiences (hint: certain UPDAO participation may translate directly to future gaming outcomes). (source: Reimagining DAOs — How Pixel Vault Simplified the Complex)​Beta TestingPrior to launch, beta testing of PRISM was previously open to holders of at least 1 planet. Testers had the opportunity to share their thoughts/ideas/feedback, and had the chance to receive $POW rewards for their contributions.Original AnnouncementAttention, all inhabitants of the planetary ecosystem! We are initiating our search for bright,active minds and strong contributors across the solar system to help lay the foundation for interplanetary governance and cooperation. The system’s best are being asked to come review the planetary referendum and sustainability machine, errr PRISM, for any weaknesses and flaws in our systems. To provide the optimal experience, we must have a variety of perspectives: from those who have curated whole planet sets to those concerned citizens holding a singular planet. Dedication to the UPDAO will be rewarded (did someone say $POW…), and there will be glory—your contributions at this critical juncture will never be forgotten by the United Planets. To qualify for these bounties, you must be:Holding 1+ planet(s)Eager to participate by sharing your thoughts and ideas, as well as weighing in on others’ ideas, thoughtfullyOpen to providing feedback - for the galactic governance platform and to the UPDAO as a whole!

Each Planet has their own distinct environment, and it’s where Universe’s stories will take place, and where characters like Inhabitants Identities or DOTs come from. Mirroring our real world, there are 9 planets and 1 moon.Structurally, each Planet is designed to be its own decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). Collectors are able to purchase and own Planetary DAO tokens. These tokens represent proportional ownership of, and therefore voting power in, the specific Planet.What is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)?DAOs are the web3 version of companies/communities. Here's a very concise definition from Packy McCormick:Packy: More simply, DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. Instead of a top-down hierarchical structure, they use Web3 technology and rapidly evolving governance and incentive systems to distribute decision-making authority and financial rewards. Typically, they do that by issuing tokens based on participation, contribution, and investment. Token holders then have the ability to submit proposals, vote, and share in the upside. (source: The Dao of DAOs)​Here’s each of the planets and their corresponding token supply:The token supply of each Planet is determined by the real-world radius of the Planet in kilometersExample: with 244 Mercury DAO tokens, you'd have 10% voting power for what happens on Mercury (244/2440 = 10%)United Planets DAOThe United Planets DAO, or UPDAO is like the Federal Government or United Nations. It’s where every Planet comes together to make decisions on behalf of the Inhabitants Universe as a whole.Note: Pixel Vault has been building a custom UPDAO voting dashboard called Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (PRISM). For the latest news, check out UPDAO Voting Dashboard (PRISM).Each planet has a fixed amount of voting power within the UPDAO:A breakdown of the voting power that each Planet has within the United Planets DAO (source)​Example: Mercury has 5 out of 193 votes within the UPDAO, giving them 2.6% voting power.

It's the idea of converting the fast twitch play you get with a League of Legends type game, and turning it into more of a strategic affair. You get to watch cool video game action but really what you're doing is making strategic choices around a game economy. We zeroed in on doing all the strategic stuff but having the fights look like superheroes going to town on each other. I don't see another game that blends those genres."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""We’re also inviting other projects to throw down in the auto brawler so there’ll be some seasons where we feature other IP which will be interesting – seeing how you match up against other known projects as well as other projects that PV will be releasing in the future. The idea is to create not just a PV brawler, but a web3 brawler that anyone can battle in."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)""We’re going to do it all browser based. So you don’t need to buy any rig or anything like that. As soon as we get the auto-brawler out, the next plan is to try and get it on to mobile devices."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identity holders will be able to play with their Identities, or draft them (i.e. let other people pay to use it)""Of course, you can play with your own MetaHeroes, because that's awesome and you should get special privileges. But if you choose to, you can park your MetaHero and let people pay you to use it. That's the seed of the idea. It'll be a little more interesting because you still have game theoretic choices when you put your MetaHero up for draft that affect how appealing they are to choose from. You'll be competing against other MetaHeroes to get the intention of people who are using $POW to play the game. It's going to create an interesting marketplace dynamic around MetaHero traits."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""The way that it’s going to work is when you’re playing in tournament mode, there’s an entry fee to start and then you have a bunch of strategic choices to make. The first most important one is how you want to assemble your team. If you have MetaHeroes, it saves you choices that you can make on other things in the game, like which powers you want to use, or how many powers you want to equip in your first round. And so having MetaHeroes gives you more flexibility in the options that you have, but you still need a full team of three to play."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identities will have powers related to their traits, but in addition, another collectible asset will be introduced to represent powers that can be used for battle""Each MetaHero will have powers relative to their attributes. When we launch the game, we'll start with a few attributes. They will be unique powers that only MetaHeroes have. Eventually, I want to have them for as many attributes as makes sense. By virtue of those attributes, the MetaHeroes will automatically get them during battle. In addition, we'll introduce another asset that represents powers that can be used - not by any MetaHero - cos there's planets and certain specialities of MetaHeroes. It's a little like a collectible card game. If I don't have a MetaHero, I can collect these powers and apply them to MetaHeroes as appropriate, as they're available for draft, as they go into battle. My strategic decisions are: what powers do I have? Which MetaHeroes do they match up with the best? Which planets will I be fighting on? What do I know about my opponents?"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""They’ll start as a layer 2 NFT and then as you play with them and use the NFT more and more and level up your hero, level up the superpower itself, you have the opportunity to convert it over to a mainnet asset. And so the idea is to not dilute mainnet NFTs by making it very hard and skill based for which superpowers actually ultimately make it there."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​Gear Pods are re-usable and will be a constant source of goodies, with a risk/rewards element""There's a special spot in my heart for gear pods. I'm not going to give away many details. You'll be able to open your gear pod. There’ll be stuff you can use in this game for it. We are in the process of making multiple games. I’m not making a single game, I’m making a platform for many games. I want this game to represent the first game in a long series of games that PV will be responsible for. But that also opens up a pathway where other partners and communities can get involved. Gear pods are going to be essential to that. There’ll be a gamified opening - when you can open it, you’ll get what’s inside, then they'll close and you'll have the opportunity to recharge them. There'll be a little mini game - like a gamified aspect to it, where there's risk and rewards to opening it, every time you open it. It'll be a constant source of goodies depending on how you play that game."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​Planet tokens can be staked to earn rewards and planet holders will be able to participate in their own mini games""There’s a couple different pathways for planet holders. You will get matched up against teams. Sometimes you’ll know which teams/planets you get matched up against, sometimes you won't. The planets you end up playing on – if you have staked your planet token - the planets will have a participatory game mechanic similar to MetaHeroes where they can earn rewards for participating through staking. The winner has to play some portion of winning rewards to the planet for hosting. That's a piece of it but there's actually a lot more. There's a whole other almost mini game for planet holders which will determine how big of a reward, how often the planet shows up for battle, and how much of a bonus MH from that planet will get when they fight on that planet"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​$POW will be instrumental to the game & gaming ecosystem$POW will be instrument for playing the game. One of my hopes is that we’ll get people outside the community interested in $POW because they want to play the game. It’s instrumentally important to this protocol that we teased in the video. (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)Those without PV assets will still be able to play""The game is designed to have different modes and tiers, largely in part due to the accessibility question. Want it to be easy for people to get into the game, play it, get a feel for it. They may not get as much out of it as they could - it’s so much funner if you really get into the community if you know what I mean - and if you’re in the community then it’s a different game. There'll be different challenges available to you. We want a pathway for people outside the community to get in, and special perks for those in the community."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)The grand ambition for Pixel Vault is to build a decentralised gaming protocol, which any developer can adopt to distribute, monetise, promote and publish games.""I didn't come to Pixel Vault to make a single game or even a bunch of games. The most important thing to have an ecosystem based around games that is completely decentralised. If anyone has developed games before, they know the market for games is ridiculously competitive. My theory is that it's due to these centralised platforms. What PV is incubating - that I'm most excited about - is to act as a flagship title for demonstrating the features of this completely decentralised platform for distributing, monetising, promoting games and publishing games. That's the idea behind this protocol. We're working with a team that's building it. We're releasing it as an open protocol that any developer can adopt. The game is the cherry on top of this huge cake that'll change the way games are made forever in my mind.""

Each Planet has their own distinct environment, and it’s where Universe’s stories will take place, and where characters like Inhabitants Identities or DOTs come from. Mirroring our real world, there are 9 planets and 1 moon.Structurally, each Planet is designed to be its own decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). Collectors are able to purchase and own Planetary DAO tokens. These tokens represent proportional ownership of, and therefore voting power in, the specific Planet.What is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)?DAOs are the web3 version of companies/communities. Here's a very concise definition from Packy McCormick:Packy: More simply, DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. Instead of a top-down hierarchical structure, they use Web3 technology and rapidly evolving governance and incentive systems to distribute decision-making authority and financial rewards. Typically, they do that by issuing tokens based on participation, contribution, and investment. Token holders then have the ability to submit proposals, vote, and share in the upside. (source: The Dao of DAOs)​Here’s each of the planets and their corresponding token supply:The token supply of each Planet is determined by the real-world radius of the Planet in kilometersExample: with 244 Mercury DAO tokens, you'd have 10% voting power for what happens on Mercury (244/2440 = 10%)United Planets DAOThe United Planets DAO, or UPDAO is like the Federal Government or United Nations. It’s where every Planet comes together to make decisions on behalf of the Inhabitants Universe as a whole.Note: Pixel Vault has been building a custom UPDAO voting dashboard called Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (PRISM). For the latest news, check out UPDAO Voting Dashboard (PRISM).Each planet has a fixed amount of voting power within the UPDAO:A breakdown of the voting power that each Planet has within the United Planets DAO (source)​Example: Mercury has 5 out of 193 votes within the UPDAO, giving them 2.6% voting power.

It’s where every Planet comes together to make decisions on behalf of the Universe as a whole. Each planet has a fixed amount of voting power within the UPDAO.Pixel Vault's ambition is to turn the Inhabitants Universe into a decentralised gaming platform owned and governed by fans. A core part of this are the planets, as each planet token represents proportional ownership and voting power in the specific planet. Together, the 10 planets/DAOs make decisions in the broader UPDAO.To enable this experience, Pixel Vault has to:create a voting experience which allows the DAOs (planets + UPDAO) to interact with each othercreate an intuitive user experience which makes DAO participation fun & easy, especially given collectors can be part of multiple DAOs (i.e. owning multiple planet tokens)To do this, Pixel Vault has been building a custom UPDAO voting dashboard called Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (PRISM).Planet Referendum and Independence Sustainability Machine (“PRISM”) is a forum and voting hub for Planet token holders. It’s also home to all the information one might need when learning about the UPDAO. PRISM offers a streamlined UI/UX for collectors to seamlessly make decisions for 10 planetary DAOs and the overarching UPDAO. Pixel Vault built PRISM because the current tools for DAO participation are bifurcated, and results in decreased participation by DAO members. PRISM implements discussion into the voting mechanics, eliminating the need for two separate apps. PRISM has been designed to make governance intuitive and fun for broad audiences (hint: certain UPDAO participation may translate directly to future gaming outcomes).

The biggest news to date is the announcement that Pixel Vault has secured 2 big partnerships with:​Major League Baseball (MLB)​​Dana White + his family​Here's what's been shared so far:GFunk: we want to give an opportunity for inclusivity and to welcome more and more people into this Web3 environment in a way that speaks to them. And today, all of the the projects that have focused on sports have really leaned into the idea of digital trading cards, and that is not what we'll be doing. We’ll continue to be storytellers, driving awesome utility to these tokens, one-of-one type experiences, access to different events. (source: MetaVault: May 11th Town Hall Recap).Q5: Are you planning to work with individual athletes under PV sports?Athletes will have the opportunity to star in their own PUNKS Comic shorts that will blend our fictional PUNKS Universe + integrate some of the attributes that define their personalities and careers. This will extend beyond sports to other icons (in time) to continually increase the cultural touchpoints for the IP. Each of these limited edition comics will be paired with unique utility for the holders, including merch and/or one-of-a-kind experiences. Issues will be provided to the PUNKS community as an airdrop via provably fair giveaways due to the limited supply.We are planning a Twitter Spaces in the near-term to introduce Tzvi Twersky, Head of PV Sports, to tell his story, the broader vision for PV Sports, and how this vision will directly benefit our current PUNKS and MetaHero Universe holders.Q6: Can you explain the rationale for Pixel Vault Sports and some of the other marketing partnerships that were announced recently?With regards to our strategic approach to launch PV Sports and other marketing partnerships, we have done audience research and found the categories of sports, music, entertainment, and lifestyle fuel culture and are made of passionate communities. We believe that NFTs are a great fit for these areas of interest and tapping into culture is good for the company, our collectors, and the IP. This will also provide the opportunity for collectors to choose what they are most passionate about and focus their time, engagement, and dollars accordingly.An example of how we did this previously was with the adidas Into the Metaverse campaign. We saw 22,000 unique holders across 30,000 NFTs, with many making this their first NFT to date. We did not simply attract existing collectors, we tapped into culture and made NFTs a topic of interest outside our smaller crypto-native community. The campaign was picked up by the mainstream media, driving awareness and positive sentiment to not just Pixel Vault, but the space at large.We will continue to selectively allocate time and resources to these efforts and focus on working with partners that will be long-term builders in the space and drive value to collectors.

Holders of this set are entitled to a free PUNKS PFP, which will become the access pass to PUNKS content & utility moving forwardand most significantly, it was a gamified pack style drop, which led to the redistribution of over 1600 Pixel Vault assets from PV, back to their communityThere are 3 editions of PUNKS Comic #3Pack Style DropTypically, when you're minting an NFT, you have a general idea of what asset you'll receive, even though there can be an element of randomness in terms of the output. For example, when you burn your MintPass #1 for a Generative Inhabitants Identity, you know you'll receive a Generative but it's traits are randomised. However, Pixel Vault gamified the experience of minting PUNKS Comic #3 by allowing minters a chance of receiving another Pixel Vault asset instead of a PUNKS Comic #3 standard edition.Here's how it worked:The mint was designed to take place over 4 mint windows. A snapshot of Pixel Vault asset holders was taken to determine who could mint in each window, and how many they could mint. For example, priority was given to genesis token holders, followed by planet holders.In total, there were 18,000 NFTs to be minted. During the minting process, collectors could pay 0.2 ETH to mint for a randomised chance of receiving one of the following assets:3 variations of PUNKS Comic #3standard (14,693 distributed, and 307 held back by Pixel Vault)collector's editions with an alternate cover (1,500)holographic cover signed by GFunk & Chris Wahl (150)genesis tokens from the Pixel Vault treasury which they acquired as part of their separation from Beanie​​PUNKS Comic #1 (130)​Pixel Vault Founder's DAO (665)​MintPass #1 (350)​Generative Inhabitants Identities (500)​Pixel Vault Core Identities (12) OutcomeIn total, 1,657 genesis tokens from the Pixel Vault treasury were distributed back to the Pixel Vault community via the mint.ResourcesPUNKS by Pixel VaultThe official PUNKS Comic #3 pagePUNKS Comic Issue #3 — What you Need to Know + FAQMediumFAQs for PUNKS Comic #3PreviousPUNKS Comic #2: Elite Ape Collector's EditionsNextGamification of the Inhabitants UniverseLast modified 4mo agoCopy linkOn this pagePack Style DropOutcomeResources ",https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/learn/gamification/punks/comic3

Collectors have had the choice to:​Stake for $PUNKS tokens, representing proportional ownership of CryptoPunks​​Burn for access to the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO or Moon DAO​Stake for $PUNKSPUNKS Comic #1 enables holders to gain proportional ownership over the 16 CryptoPunks which inspired the PUNKS characters. Here’s how it works:the 16 CryptoPunks were locked into a vault via the platform Fractional​Fractional created 100,000,000 $PUNKS tokens to represent ownership of the 16 CryptoPunks in the vault.PUNKS Comic #1 holders can stake (i.e. lock away) their comic over 2 years to earn $PUNKS tokensBurn for DAOsPUNKS Comic #1 was the key to two of Pixel Vault’s most exclusive DAOs: the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO (PVFD) and the Moon DAO.To receive either of those DAO tokens, holders needed to burn their PUNKS Comic #1. This means permanently removing the comic token from the available supply, and giving up the option to stake it for $PUNKS tokens, as well as the right to claim a physical copy.Collectors had to decide for themselves what they valued most, e.g.did they care most about the comic, for its value as a collectible (as an NFT & as a physical comic) and the ability to gain fractional ownership over the 16 CryptoPunks?did they want to be part of the Pixel Vault Founder’s DAO, for ownership over the vault of assets, exposure to everything PV creates, and the chance to hang out, and build with all the other passionate Pixel Vault fans?or were they more excited by the MetaHero gaming platform, and the opportunity to be part of one of its most exclusive and influential DAOs?and the game theory - if more are burning for PVFD or Moon DAO, does that make Comic #1 more valuable, given the $PUNKS earning rate increases and the comic becomes more scarce?OutcomeThe original 10,000 supply of PUNKS Comic #1 has fallen to 3371. Alongside it are now 5902 PVFD tokens, and 710 Moon DAO tokens.Fun Fact #1: if you do the math, 3371 + 5902 + 710 = 9,983. Here’s what happened to the missing 17.Fun Fact #2: Bad actors exploited a vulnerability which let them burn PUNKS Comic #1 NFTs that they didn’t own, and receive Moon DAO tokens. 58 comics were affected. In response, Pixel Vault compensated those affected with a Special Edition Comic #1, and re-issued the Moon DAO tokens. The exploited Moon DAO is now called The Dark Moon.

It'll be released in two sets:Set 1: Issues 1-8Set 2: Issues 9-16GamificationHere's how it works: Origin Stories Issue 1 was dedicated to the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO (PVFD), so the total supply was originally 5,902 (in line with the number of PVFD tokens)For Origin Stories Issues 2-8, each new issue can only be claimed by collectors who burn one of the previous issues, during a limited time window that's open until the release of the following issue. This means the total supply of all 8 Origin Stories Set 1 NFTs is 5,902. For example:When Issue 4 is released, all holders of Issues 1-3 are able to burn their NFTs to receive Issue 4. When Issue 5 is released, the claim for Issue 4 will be closed, and the maximum supply of Issue 4 will be set. From that point onwards, it'll be deflationary as it can be burnt for Issues 5-8Holders of the full Set 1 (Issues 1-8) will receive a physical premium bound copy of all 8 issuesCollectors have a lot of decisions to make:do they want to collect the full set of 8 to be eligible to receive the physical? Keep in mind, given the supply of Origin Stories Set 1 is fixed to 5,902, there can only be a maximum of 737 full sets, which makes the physical quite scarceif not, do they want to hold onto the issue they have, or burn to claim a new issue? What if there's a character or guest artist that they resonate with in the new issue?and the game theory - in each of the 7 burn windows, the supply of previous issues will be decreasing as they're burnt for the current issue.

This led to him starting his career as a Legal Intern at Warner Bros in 2013. After that, GFunk co-founded Qruber Virtual Production Office, a collaboration and workflow management tool for film and television productions. Later, he became the VP of Business Development for Indiepay, an accounting software for production teams. In his final role before founding PV, he was the Head of Growth at Syfer, a cybersecurity company.In terms of his crypto journey, GFunk has been around the space since 2014.Back then, any profits he made were used to support his real world businesses. Towards the end of 2020, he discovered non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through NBA Top Shot. What are non-fungible tokens (NFTs)?NFTs are a way for us to represent digital assets, so that we can own things on the internet. With NFTs, we can verify:ownership: who owns a digital asset?authenticity: do they own the real thing?Having grown up collecting sports cards, he could see the potential of NFTs in enabling the ownership of digital assets. He quickly fell down the NFT rabbithole; making money flipping projects like Hashmasks, collecting digital and generative art like on Art Blocks, and finding himself welcomed by the CryptoPunks community.What are CryptoPunks?CryptoPunks are a collection of 10,000 pixelated characters and one of the early NFT collections. They’re widely seen as being historically significant for their role in igniting the popularity and growth of NFTs. For more on this and a backstory of the CryptoPunks, Sandra Upson’s piece ‘The 10,000 Faces That Launched an NFT Revolution’ is a great read.At that point in time, early in 2021, GFunk noticed many individuals developing brands with their CryptoPunks, like @ClaireSilver12, @punk4156 and @gmoneyNFT . However, with his background in the entertainment industry, he realised no-one was developing intellectual property (IP) behind NFTs in the traditional sense, i.e. by crafting narrative and stories.The question he asked was: GFunk: “What if we could create a narrative behind these stagnant on-chain assets, that drove value beyond the collectability standpoint?” (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​And just like that, the concept of Pixel Vault was born.The birth of Pixel VaultTo start, GFunk teamed up with Preston Johnson a.k.a. SportsCheetah. They had their targets set on building stories around CryptoPunks. But there was one big problem; a lack of capital.The original Pixel Vault logoAfter reaching out to many crypto & NFT influencers/investors, GFunk managed to form a partnership with Beanie. Beanie invested the capital that Pixel Vault needed to launch, and offered up 13 of his own CryptoPunks. Meanwhile, GFunk and SportsCheetah were able to pull together 3 of their own. Without Beanie’s investment, Pixel Vault wouldn’t have been able to launch.The 16 CryptoPunks which started Pixel Vault (source)​With these 16 CryptoPunks to work with, Pixel Vault launched their first NFT collection on May 10 2021: PUNKS Comic Issue #1. They created characters inspired by the look of the 16 CryptoPunks, and brought them to life through a comic. It took 5 weeks to sell out the 10,000 comics, generating 2,000 ETH in sales.Examples of how PV transformed the CryptoPunks into characters. From left to right: Courtney (Punk #2146), The Futurist (Punk #9723), GFunk (Punk #1288) and Hilary (Punk #2041) (source)​For GFunk, selling out was a big deal.

It was founded in May 2021 by Sean Gearin (a.k.a GFunk). Since then, it has become one of the most ambitious companies in web3, looking to:redefine the future of storytelling, media & entertainment, gaming and sports; andbuild universes as big and as compelling as Disney and MarvelGFunk: ""Pixel Vault’s greatest differentiator is our team. Bull market or bear, we are a team of builders, relentlessly dedicated to telling great stories and embracing new technology for and alongside our community. We have never been more motivated than we are today."" (source: From the Desk: An Open Letter to the Pixel Vault Community)​To make sense of Pixel Vault:​understand how and why they do what they do ​get to know their history & key partnerships​​learn the core purpose and value of each individual asset within their ecosystem​​explore how everything fits together by diving into Pixel Vault's gamification of their ecosystem assets​The Pixel Vault rabbit hole is constantly getting deeper, so once you've done all that - check out What's On to stay up to speed.Understanding Pixel VaultThe Pixel Vault ecosystem is complicated. Because of that, it’s important to understand how PV thinks about building their products, and designing experiences.There are 3 aspects which make Pixel Vault, Pixel Vault.​they're committed to storytelling & empowering their fans to own and build alongside them​​a desire to make every step of the way fun for collectors​​they're relentlessly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with web3 tech ​Develop crypto-native IP assets, and tell their storiesPixel Vault's ambition is to build universes as big and as compelling as Disney and Marvel. They’re doing this through the power of storytelling, and across a broad range of channels. Think: comics, television, movies, video games, consumer goods, real-life experiences and much more. However, there’s one major difference between Pixel Vault & Disney: PV is building with web3 technologies & principles.GFunk: “We do not look at the fan as the customer. Our fans are the owner and the builder.” (source: Pixel Vault banks $100 million in funding to chase an NFT media empire)​To break that down:Fans as owners: PV develops “crypto-native IP assets” in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They wants their IP assets to be owned by their fans. That way, the success of PV in building a broad fan-base through the stories they tell and the media they create, is the fan’s success as well (as value accrues to the IP assets over time)Fans as builders: IP assets in traditional media companies are tightly protected. However, PV wants to build alongside their fans, rather than treating them as customers and passive consumers of their media. For example, PV will let their fans contribute to stories, and also give full commercial rights to owners of some of their IP assets. Since fans are owners, they’re incentivised to help build with PVGFunk: We’re an IP business leveraging next generation technologies. We’re still approaching IP in a way that’s very similar to what these legacy institutions are doing, but we’re doing it in a way that actually benefits the broader community. This collective mind of our community all working together to develop this IP is going to be tremendously disruptive to legacy institutions. You’ve seen Amazon and Netflix already disrupt what the traditional studios were doing, and I think this is the next logical progression of where that’s going. (source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)​Make web3 funOne thing Pixel Vault has become renowned for, is gamifying the collector experience. For the nitty-gritty details of this, check out the Gamification section. Otherwise, just know this:PV wants each person’s collection of their assets to reflect their own decisions - based on their unique personality, personal preferences and risk appetite. Being one of their collectors is like being a part of the game that is Pixel Vault, orchestrated by GFunk and his team.This all stems from GFunk’s desire to create an active, engaged and fun collector experience:GFunk: At the end of the day, NFTs should be fun. If it's not bringing a smile to your face, you're doing something wrong (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​It’s a lot of - do you do Option 1 because of X & Y, or Option 2 because of Z. In the first instance, it may seem like one option is clearly better. But then there’s the game theory element. What if more people go with Option 2, does Option 1 start to become preferable? And then what if Option 3 is unexpectedly introduced?!Also, PV is thinking more broadly than just the collector experience. They want to make participating in the web3 ecosystem more fun and easy in general, for example, by gamifying DAO participation to incentivise engagement.Build web3 idea legos​Packy McCormick, who writes Not Boring, talks about the concept of idea legos. He argues that in web3, every new experiment is a building block for the future; a lego piece that anyone can pick up and use. Even if the things being built look silly or stupid, everything helps to compound human knowledge, enabling us to build faster & potentially solve more and more complex problems.Pixel Vault are constantly building new idea legos which solve problems within the space, and push the boundaries of what’s possible using web3 tech. These legos not only enable PV themselves to build faster and create new experiences, but it helps the broader space too.

Each iteration we’ll be improving game balance, sort of like the look and feel of it.

One of the things that came out of that process was a battler. I'm a strategic game player. It's the idea of converting the fast twitch play you get with a League of Legends type game, and turning it into more of a strategic affair. You get to watch cool video game action but really what you're doing is making strategic choices around a game economy. We zeroed in on doing all the strategic stuff but having the fights look like superheroes going to town on each other. I don't see another game that blends those genres."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""We’re also inviting other projects to throw down in the auto brawler so there’ll be some seasons where we feature other IP which will be interesting – seeing how you match up against other known projects as well as other projects that PV will be releasing in the future. The idea is to create not just a PV brawler, but a web3 brawler that anyone can battle in."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)""We’re going to do it all browser based. So you don’t need to buy any rig or anything like that. As soon as we get the auto-brawler out, the next plan is to try and get it on to mobile devices."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identity holders will be able to play with their Identities, or draft them (i.e. let other people pay to use it)""Of course, you can play with your own MetaHeroes, because that's awesome and you should get special privileges. But if you choose to, you can park your MetaHero and let people pay you to use it. That's the seed of the idea. It'll be a little more interesting because you still have game theoretic choices when you put your MetaHero up for draft that affect how appealing they are to choose from. You'll be competing against other MetaHeroes to get the intention of people who are using $POW to play the game. It's going to create an interesting marketplace dynamic around MetaHero traits."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""The way that it’s going to work is when you’re playing in tournament mode, there’s an entry fee to start and then you have a bunch of strategic choices to make. The first most important one is how you want to assemble your team. If you have MetaHeroes, it saves you choices that you can make on other things in the game, like which powers you want to use, or how many powers you want to equip in your first round. And so having MetaHeroes gives you more flexibility in the options that you have, but you still need a full team of three to play."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identities will have powers related to their traits, but in addition, another collectible asset will be introduced to represent powers that can be used for battle""Each MetaHero will have powers relative to their attributes. When we launch the game, we'll start with a few attributes. They will be unique powers that only MetaHeroes have. Eventually, I want to have them for as many attributes as makes sense. By virtue of those attributes, the MetaHeroes will automatically get them during battle. In addition, we'll introduce another asset that represents powers that can be used - not by any MetaHero - cos there's planets and certain specialities of MetaHeroes. It's a little like a collectible card game. If I don't have a MetaHero, I can collect these powers and apply them to MetaHeroes as appropriate, as they're available for draft, as they go into battle. My strategic decisions are: what powers do I have? Which MetaHeroes do they match up with the best? Which planets will I be fighting on? What do I know about my opponents?"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""They’ll start as a layer 2 NFT and then as you play with them and use the NFT more and more and level up your hero, level up the superpower itself, you have the opportunity to convert it over to a mainnet asset. And so the idea is to not dilute mainnet NFTs by making it very hard and skill based for which superpowers actually ultimately make it there."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​Gear Pods are re-usable and will be a constant source of goodies, with a risk/rewards element""There's a special spot in my heart for gear pods. I'm not going to give away many details. You'll be able to open your gear pod. There’ll be stuff you can use in this game for it. We are in the process of making multiple games. I’m not making a single game, I’m making a platform for many games. I want this game to represent the first game in a long series of games that PV will be responsible for. But that also opens up a pathway where other partners and communities can get involved. Gear pods are going to be essential to that. There’ll be a gamified opening - when you can open it, you’ll get what’s inside, then they'll close and you'll have the opportunity to recharge them. There'll be a little mini game - like a gamified aspect to it, where there's risk and rewards to opening it, every time you open it. It'll be a constant source of goodies depending on how you play that game."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​Planet tokens can be staked to earn rewards and planet holders will be able to participate in their own mini games""There’s a couple different pathways for planet holders. You will get matched up against teams. Sometimes you’ll know which teams/planets you get matched up against, sometimes you won't. The planets you end up playing on – if you have staked your planet token - the planets will have a participatory game mechanic similar to MetaHeroes where they can earn rewards for participating through staking. The winner has to play some portion of winning rewards to the planet for hosting. That's a piece of it but there's actually a lot more. There's a whole other almost mini game for planet holders which will determine how big of a reward, how often the planet shows up for battle, and how much of a bonus MH from that planet will get when they fight on that planet"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​$POW will be instrumental to the game & gaming ecosystem$POW will be instrument for playing the game. One of my hopes is that we’ll get people outside the community interested in $POW because they want to play the game. It’s instrumentally important to this protocol that we teased in the video. (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)Those without PV assets will still be able to play""The game is designed to have different modes and tiers, largely in part due to the accessibility question. Want it to be easy for people to get into the game, play it, get a feel for it. They may not get as much out of it as they could - it’s so much funner if you really get into the community if you know what I mean - and if you’re in the community then it’s a different game. There'll be different challenges available to you. We want a pathway for people outside the community to get in, and special perks for those in the community."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)The grand ambition for Pixel Vault is to build a decentralised gaming protocol, which any developer can adopt to distribute, monetise, promote and publish games.""I didn't come to Pixel Vault to make a single game or even a bunch of games. The most important thing to have an ecosystem based around games that is completely decentralised. If anyone has developed games before, they know the market for games is ridiculously competitive. My theory is that it's due to these centralised platforms. What PV is incubating - that I'm most excited about - is to act as a flagship title for demonstrating the features of this completely decentralised platform for distributing, monetising, promoting games and publishing games. That's the idea behind this protocol. We're working with a team that's building it. We're releasing it as an open protocol that any developer can adopt. The game is the cherry on top of this huge cake that'll change the way games are made forever in my mind.""

This led to him starting his career as a Legal Intern at Warner Bros in 2013. After that, GFunk co-founded Qruber Virtual Production Office, a collaboration and workflow management tool for film and television productions. Later, he became the VP of Business Development for Indiepay, an accounting software for production teams. In his final role before founding PV, he was the Head of Growth at Syfer, a cybersecurity company.In terms of his crypto journey, GFunk has been around the space since 2014.Back then, any profits he made were used to support his real world businesses. Towards the end of 2020, he discovered non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through NBA Top Shot. What are non-fungible tokens (NFTs)?NFTs are a way for us to represent digital assets, so that we can own things on the internet. With NFTs, we can verify:ownership: who owns a digital asset?authenticity: do they own the real thing?Having grown up collecting sports cards, he could see the potential of NFTs in enabling the ownership of digital assets. He quickly fell down the NFT rabbithole; making money flipping projects like Hashmasks, collecting digital and generative art like on Art Blocks, and finding himself welcomed by the CryptoPunks community.What are CryptoPunks?CryptoPunks are a collection of 10,000 pixelated characters and one of the early NFT collections. They’re widely seen as being historically significant for their role in igniting the popularity and growth of NFTs. For more on this and a backstory of the CryptoPunks, Sandra Upson’s piece ‘The 10,000 Faces That Launched an NFT Revolution’ is a great read.At that point in time, early in 2021, GFunk noticed many individuals developing brands with their CryptoPunks, like @ClaireSilver12, @punk4156 and @gmoneyNFT . However, with his background in the entertainment industry, he realised no-one was developing intellectual property (IP) behind NFTs in the traditional sense, i.e. by crafting narrative and stories.The question he asked was: GFunk: “What if we could create a narrative behind these stagnant on-chain assets, that drove value beyond the collectability standpoint?” (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​And just like that, the concept of Pixel Vault was born.The birth of Pixel VaultTo start, GFunk teamed up with Preston Johnson a.k.a. SportsCheetah. They had their targets set on building stories around CryptoPunks. But there was one big problem; a lack of capital.The original Pixel Vault logoAfter reaching out to many crypto & NFT influencers/investors, GFunk managed to form a partnership with Beanie. Beanie invested the capital that Pixel Vault needed to launch, and offered up 13 of his own CryptoPunks. Meanwhile, GFunk and SportsCheetah were able to pull together 3 of their own. Without Beanie’s investment, Pixel Vault wouldn’t have been able to launch.The 16 CryptoPunks which started Pixel Vault (source)​With these 16 CryptoPunks to work with, Pixel Vault launched their first NFT collection on May 10 2021: PUNKS Comic Issue #1. They created characters inspired by the look of the 16 CryptoPunks, and brought them to life through a comic. It took 5 weeks to sell out the 10,000 comics, generating 2,000 ETH in sales.Examples of how PV transformed the CryptoPunks into characters. From left to right: Courtney (Punk #2146), The Futurist (Punk #9723), GFunk (Punk #1288) and Hilary (Punk #2041) (source)​For GFunk, selling out was a big deal. He’s openly shared the fact that he borrowed money from his mum, stepdad and friends.GFunk: “I was all in with everything I owned and then some, to launch this project. My whole life was on the line with that comic” (source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)​Learn About Pixel Vault - PreviousHistoryNextSeparation from BeanieLast modified 8mo agoCopy linkOn this pageGFunk meets NFTsThe birth of Pixel Vault ",https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/learn/history/pv-origins#the-birth-of-pixel-vault

It was founded in May 2021 by Sean Gearin (a.k.a GFunk). Since then, it has become one of the most ambitious companies in web3, looking to:redefine the future of storytelling, media & entertainment, gaming and sports; andbuild universes as big and as compelling as Disney and MarvelGFunk: ""Pixel Vault’s greatest differentiator is our team. Bull market or bear, we are a team of builders, relentlessly dedicated to telling great stories and embracing new technology for and alongside our community. We have never been more motivated than we are today."" (source: From the Desk: An Open Letter to the Pixel Vault Community)​To make sense of Pixel Vault:​understand how and why they do what they do ​get to know their history & key partnerships​​learn the core purpose and value of each individual asset within their ecosystem​​explore how everything fits together by diving into Pixel Vault's gamification of their ecosystem assets​The Pixel Vault rabbit hole is constantly getting deeper, so once you've done all that - check out What's On to stay up to speed.Understanding Pixel VaultThe Pixel Vault ecosystem is complicated. Because of that, it’s important to understand how PV thinks about building their products, and designing experiences.There are 3 aspects which make Pixel Vault, Pixel Vault.​they're committed to storytelling & empowering their fans to own and build alongside them​​a desire to make every step of the way fun for collectors​​they're relentlessly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with web3 tech ​Develop crypto-native IP assets, and tell their storiesPixel Vault's ambition is to build universes as big and as compelling as Disney and Marvel. They’re doing this through the power of storytelling, and across a broad range of channels. Think: comics, television, movies, video games, consumer goods, real-life experiences and much more. However, there’s one major difference between Pixel Vault & Disney: PV is building with web3 technologies & principles.GFunk: “We do not look at the fan as the customer. Our fans are the owner and the builder.” (source: Pixel Vault banks $100 million in funding to chase an NFT media empire)​To break that down:Fans as owners: PV develops “crypto-native IP assets” in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They wants their IP assets to be owned by their fans. That way, the success of PV in building a broad fan-base through the stories they tell and the media they create, is the fan’s success as well (as value accrues to the IP assets over time)Fans as builders: IP assets in traditional media companies are tightly protected. However, PV wants to build alongside their fans, rather than treating them as customers and passive consumers of their media. For example, PV will let their fans contribute to stories, and also give full commercial rights to owners of some of their IP assets. Since fans are owners, they’re incentivised to help build with PVGFunk: We’re an IP business leveraging next generation technologies. We’re still approaching IP in a way that’s very similar to what these legacy institutions are doing, but we’re doing it in a way that actually benefits the broader community. This collective mind of our community all working together to develop this IP is going to be tremendously disruptive to legacy institutions. You’ve seen Amazon and Netflix already disrupt what the traditional studios were doing, and I think this is the next logical progression of where that’s going. (source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)​Make web3 funOne thing Pixel Vault has become renowned for, is gamifying the collector experience. For the nitty-gritty details of this, check out the Gamification section. Otherwise, just know this:PV wants each person’s collection of their assets to reflect their own decisions - based on their unique personality, personal preferences and risk appetite. Being one of their collectors is like being a part of the game that is Pixel Vault, orchestrated by GFunk and his team.This all stems from GFunk’s desire to create an active, engaged and fun collector experience:GFunk: At the end of the day, NFTs should be fun. If it's not bringing a smile to your face, you're doing something wrong (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​It’s a lot of - do you do Option 1 because of X & Y, or Option 2 because of Z. In the first instance, it may seem like one option is clearly better. But then there’s the game theory element. What if more people go with Option 2, does Option 1 start to become preferable? And then what if Option 3 is unexpectedly introduced?!Also, PV is thinking more broadly than just the collector experience. They want to make participating in the web3 ecosystem more fun and easy in general, for example, by gamifying DAO participation to incentivise engagement.Build web3 idea legos​Packy McCormick, who writes Not Boring, talks about the concept of idea legos. He argues that in web3, every new experiment is a building block for the future; a lego piece that anyone can pick up and use. Even if the things being built look silly or stupid, everything helps to compound human knowledge, enabling us to build faster & potentially solve more and more complex problems.Pixel Vault are constantly building new idea legos which solve problems within the space, and push the boundaries of what’s possible using web3 tech. These legos not only enable PV themselves to build faster and create new experiences, but it helps the broader space too.

(source: 10 Questions for GFunk)​Game #1) MetaHero Universe 3v3 auto-brawlerThe first iteration of the MetaHero Universe game will be a browser-based 3v3 auto-brawler:""We've been working on prototypes for games for Pixel Vault for a few months. One of the things that came out of that process was a battler. I'm a strategic game player. It's the idea of converting the fast twitch play you get with a League of Legends type game, and turning it into more of a strategic affair. You get to watch cool video game action but really what you're doing is making strategic choices around a game economy. We zeroed in on doing all the strategic stuff but having the fights look like superheroes going to town on each other. I don't see another game that blends those genres."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""We’re also inviting other projects to throw down in the auto brawler so there’ll be some seasons where we feature other IP which will be interesting – seeing how you match up against other known projects as well as other projects that PV will be releasing in the future. The idea is to create not just a PV brawler, but a web3 brawler that anyone can battle in."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)""We’re going to do it all browser based. So you don’t need to buy any rig or anything like that. As soon as we get the auto-brawler out, the next plan is to try and get it on to mobile devices."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identity holders will be able to play with their Identities, or draft them (i.e. let other people pay to use it)""Of course, you can play with your own MetaHeroes, because that's awesome and you should get special privileges. But if you choose to, you can park your MetaHero and let people pay you to use it. That's the seed of the idea. It'll be a little more interesting because you still have game theoretic choices when you put your MetaHero up for draft that affect how appealing they are to choose from. You'll be competing against other MetaHeroes to get the intention of people who are using $POW to play the game. It's going to create an interesting marketplace dynamic around MetaHero traits."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""The way that it’s going to work is when you’re playing in tournament mode, there’s an entry fee to start and then you have a bunch of strategic choices to make. The first most important one is how you want to assemble your team. If you have MetaHeroes, it saves you choices that you can make on other things in the game, like which powers you want to use, or how many powers you want to equip in your first round. And so having MetaHeroes gives you more flexibility in the options that you have, but you still need a full team of three to play."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​MetaHero Identities will have powers related to their traits, but in addition, another collectible asset will be introduced to represent powers that can be used for battle""Each MetaHero will have powers relative to their attributes. When we launch the game, we'll start with a few attributes. They will be unique powers that only MetaHeroes have. Eventually, I want to have them for as many attributes as makes sense. By virtue of those attributes, the MetaHeroes will automatically get them during battle. In addition, we'll introduce another asset that represents powers that can be used - not by any MetaHero - cos there's planets and certain specialities of MetaHeroes. It's a little like a collectible card game. If I don't have a MetaHero, I can collect these powers and apply them to MetaHeroes as appropriate, as they're available for draft, as they go into battle. My strategic decisions are: what powers do I have? Which MetaHeroes do they match up with the best? Which planets will I be fighting on? What do I know about my opponents?"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​""They’ll start as a layer 2 NFT and then as you play with them and use the NFT more and more and level up your hero, level up the superpower itself, you have the opportunity to convert it over to a mainnet asset. And so the idea is to not dilute mainnet NFTs by making it very hard and skill based for which superpowers actually ultimately make it there."" (source: Blockchain Gaming — An AMA with Aaron St. John, 15 Oct 2022)​Gear Pods are re-usable and will be a constant source of goodies, with a risk/rewards element""There's a special spot in my heart for gear pods. I'm not going to give away many details. You'll be able to open your gear pod. There’ll be stuff you can use in this game for it. We are in the process of making multiple games. I’m not making a single game, I’m making a platform for many games. I want this game to represent the first game in a long series of games that PV will be responsible for. But that also opens up a pathway where other partners and communities can get involved. Gear pods are going to be essential to that. There’ll be a gamified opening - when you can open it, you’ll get what’s inside, then they'll close and you'll have the opportunity to recharge them. There'll be a little mini game - like a gamified aspect to it, where there's risk and rewards to opening it, every time you open it. It'll be a constant source of goodies depending on how you play that game."" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​Planet tokens can be staked to earn rewards and planet holders will be able to participate in their own mini games""There’s a couple different pathways for planet holders. You will get matched up against teams. Sometimes you’ll know which teams/planets you get matched up against, sometimes you won't. The planets you end up playing on – if you have staked your planet token - the planets will have a participatory game mechanic similar to MetaHeroes where they can earn rewards for participating through staking. The winner has to play some portion of winning rewards to the planet for hosting. That's a piece of it but there's actually a lot more. There's a whole other almost mini game for planet holders which will determine how big of a reward, how often the planet shows up for battle, and how much of a bonus MH from that planet will get when they fight on that planet"" (source: Aaron from the Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)​$POW will be instrumental to the game & gaming ecosystem$POW will be instrument for playing the game. One of my hopes is that we’ll get people outside the community interested in $POW because they want to play the game. It’s instrumentally important to this protocol that we teased in the video. (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)Those without PV assets will still be able to play""The game is designed to have different modes and tiers, largely in part due to the accessibility question. Want it to be easy for people to get into the game, play it, get a feel for it. They may not get as much out of it as they could - it’s so much funner if you really get into the community if you know what I mean - and if you’re in the community then it’s a different game. There'll be different challenges available to you. We want a pathway for people outside the community to get in, and special perks for those in the community."" (source: denze's notes from Pixel Vault Blockchain Gaming Conversation, 30 Sep 2022)The grand ambition for Pixel Vault is to build a decentralised gaming protocol, which any developer can adopt to distribute, monetise, promote and publish games.""I didn't come to Pixel Vault to make a single game or even a bunch of games. The most important thing to have an ecosystem based around games that is completely decentralised. If anyone has developed games before, they know the market for games is ridiculously competitive. My theory is that it's due to these centralised platforms. What PV is incubating - that I'm most excited about - is to act as a flagship title for demonstrating the features of this completely decentralised platform for distributing, monetising, promoting games and publishing games. That's the idea behind this protocol. We're working with a team that's building it. We're releasing it as an open protocol that any developer can adopt. The game is the cherry on top of this huge cake that'll change the way games are made forever in my mind.""

Originally, Pixel Vault planned to allow multiple Gear Pod mints, with multiple sets of Nebula Gear Pod and MintPass 2 raffles. However, due to delays from organising the make-up mint, and a lack of clarity around what Gear Pods are for, POWer Up Summer ended after one set of raffles.On this page, you'll find:​context behind POWer Up Summer​details of the game mechanicsa timeline of events so far, to help you make sense of what's going onuseful resources​ContextHolders of MetaHero Identities had the option to stake for $POW over a 6-month period which ended on June 5, 2022. After this staking period ended, Pixel Vault launched POWer Up Summer to continue gamifying the experience of being a MetaHero Identity holder and to allow holders to prepare their MetaHeroes for the many games to come.In the context of the MetaHero Universe, POWer Up Summer is the beginning of a peace treaty between the MetaHeroes and DOTs, which gives MetaHeroes an opportunity to ""assemble a fleet of DOTs"" to ""promote interplanetary co-operation, expansion and discovery"".This leads to the DOTs distributing Gear Pods to MetaHeroes:What is a Gear Pod?Gear Pods are ""critical supplies"" that the DOTs are deploying to MetaHeroes to help them power up and explore the MetaHero Universe. The contents (gear) of the Gear Pods will be revealed when the Gear Pods are burned in-game. The rarity of the gear will vary with the different pods. There are 3 different types of pods:Astral Gear Pod - most commonCosmic Gear Pod - rarer than Astral, with planet-specific variations. All MetaHeroes will be able to use any gear, regardless of their planet of origin.Nebula Gear Pod - extremely rareGamificationThere are 3 key elements to POWer Up Summer. Here's how it works:1) Gear Pod mintingHolders of at least 1 MetaHero Identity AND at least 1 Planet are eligible to mint Gear Pods:What you need to know: each MetaHero Identity can be paired with up to 3 separate planet tokens, allowing holders to mint up to 3 Gear Pods per MetaHero held.

It'll be released in two sets:Set 1: Issues 1-8Set 2: Issues 9-16GamificationHere's how it works: Origin Stories Issue 1 was dedicated to the Pixel Vault Founder's DAO (PVFD), so the total supply was originally 5,902 (in line with the number of PVFD tokens)For Origin Stories Issues 2-8, each new issue can only be claimed by collectors who burn one of the previous issues, during a limited time window that's open until the release of the following issue. This means the total supply of all 8 Origin Stories Set 1 NFTs is 5,902. For example:When Issue 4 is released, all holders of Issues 1-3 are able to burn their NFTs to receive Issue 4. When Issue 5 is released, the claim for Issue 4 will be closed, and the maximum supply of Issue 4 will be set. From that point onwards, it'll be deflationary as it can be burnt for Issues 5-8Holders of the full Set 1 (Issues 1-8) will receive a physical premium bound copy of all 8 issuesCollectors have a lot of decisions to make:do they want to collect the full set of 8 to be eligible to receive the physical? Keep in mind, given the supply of Origin Stories Set 1 is fixed to 5,902, there can only be a maximum of 737 full sets, which makes the physical quite scarceif not, do they want to hold onto the issue they have, or burn to claim a new issue? What if there's a character or guest artist that they resonate with in the new issue?and the game theory - in each of the 7 burn windows, the supply of previous issues will be decreasing as they're burnt for the current issue. Which issue will become most scarce? How does that affect the value and rarity of the issue that they hold?ResourcesOrigin Stories, Issue #2 — What you Need to Know + Meet Guest Artist Siya OumMediumWhat's On - Previous🟠 Inhabitants StoriesNext - What's On🟠 UPDAO Voting Dashboad (PRISM)Last modified 4mo agoCopy linkOn this pageContextGamificationResources ",https://denze.gitbook.io/pixel-vault/whats-on/origin-stories#gamification

Each Planet has their own distinct environment, and it’s where Universe’s stories will take place, and where characters like Inhabitants Identities or DOTs come from. Mirroring our real world, there are 9 planets and 1 moon.Structurally, each Planet is designed to be its own decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). Collectors are able to purchase and own Planetary DAO tokens. These tokens represent proportional ownership of, and therefore voting power in, the specific Planet.What is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)?DAOs are the web3 version of companies/communities. Here's a very concise definition from Packy McCormick:Packy: More simply, DAOs are a new way to finance projects, govern communities, and share value. Instead of a top-down hierarchical structure, they use Web3 technology and rapidly evolving governance and incentive systems to distribute decision-making authority and financial rewards. Typically, they do that by issuing tokens based on participation, contribution, and investment. Token holders then have the ability to submit proposals, vote, and share in the upside. (source: The Dao of DAOs)​Here’s each of the planets and their corresponding token supply:The token supply of each Planet is determined by the real-world radius of the Planet in kilometersExample: with 244 Mercury DAO tokens, you'd have 10% voting power for what happens on Mercury (244/2440 = 10%)United Planets DAOThe United Planets DAO, or UPDAO is like the Federal Government or United Nations.

Laz); and​01 Advisors (led by former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and former Twitter COO Adam Bain).Note: For Laz’s inside-perspective on his investment, his post Inside Pixel Vault: The Real Story is a great read.Here’s what GFunk, Laz and Adam had to say about the partnership:GFunkGFunk: So yes, could we do this completely on our own without raising capital? We could, but it would be slower. And really it has nothing to do with the money, it has to do with aligning ourselves with like minded people with proven track records and operators themselves, right? People that know how to build businesses and people that want to take an active role in in making this the best company and the best, truly native Web3 entertainment experience it can be. And so that has been the focus in all of these conversations, finding the right partners, the right strategic people to help us build because, frankly, the money is not of concern. (source: MetaVault: Jan 12th Town Hall Recap)​ Adam, Dick, and Laz have been incredible partners. From the outset, we had been somewhat hesitant to take “VC money.” But what drew me to working with these three guys is that they're operators, they've built businesses, and they really believe in this space and the long term vision for Pixel Vault to be the first decentralized entertainment company (source: MetaVault: Feb 2nd Town Hall Recap)​LazLaz: Great entrepreneurs, they shine like a pile of diamonds. And that's what Sean has done to form the company and to give the community a chance to succeed at the highest level. (source: MetaVault: Feb 2nd Town Hall Recap)​AdamAdam: I came to Twitter in 2010, when it was less than 100 people, one office location in San Francisco and zero in revenue. And together with Dick, we took the company from 80 people to about 8500 people, in a couple years. We went from zero to $2B in revenue faster than almost any other consumer internet company on the planet. Took Twitter public in 2013, and ran a public company for a bit. And so our focus has been taking those lessons that we learned around building a real company.You know, the point that we came into Twitter, it was an amazing product. It was time to take it from being an amazing product into an amazing business and company. And so we started 01A after I left Twitter, for this exact purpose, when we realized most people in VC haven't actually built anything before. We wanted to build something for operators by operators, because we feel like we have a good way to relate to the same sort of problems and struggles.

It was founded in May 2021 by Sean Gearin (a.k.a GFunk). Since then, it has become one of the most ambitious companies in web3, looking to:redefine the future of storytelling, media & entertainment, gaming and sports; andbuild universes as big and as compelling as Disney and MarvelGFunk: ""Pixel Vault’s greatest differentiator is our team. Bull market or bear, we are a team of builders, relentlessly dedicated to telling great stories and embracing new technology for and alongside our community. We have never been more motivated than we are today."" (source: From the Desk: An Open Letter to the Pixel Vault Community)​To make sense of Pixel Vault:​understand how and why they do what they do ​get to know their history & key partnerships​​learn the core purpose and value of each individual asset within their ecosystem​​explore how everything fits together by diving into Pixel Vault's gamification of their ecosystem assets​The Pixel Vault rabbit hole is constantly getting deeper, so once you've done all that - check out What's On to stay up to speed.Understanding Pixel VaultThe Pixel Vault ecosystem is complicated. Because of that, it’s important to understand how PV thinks about building their products, and designing experiences.There are 3 aspects which make Pixel Vault, Pixel Vault.​they're committed to storytelling & empowering their fans to own and build alongside them​​a desire to make every step of the way fun for collectors​​they're relentlessly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with web3 tech ​Develop crypto-native IP assets, and tell their storiesPixel Vault's ambition is to build universes as big and as compelling as Disney and Marvel. They’re doing this through the power of storytelling, and across a broad range of channels. Think: comics, television, movies, video games, consumer goods, real-life experiences and much more. However, there’s one major difference between Pixel Vault & Disney: PV is building with web3 technologies & principles.GFunk: “We do not look at the fan as the customer. Our fans are the owner and the builder.” (source: Pixel Vault banks $100 million in funding to chase an NFT media empire)​To break that down:Fans as owners: PV develops “crypto-native IP assets” in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). They wants their IP assets to be owned by their fans. That way, the success of PV in building a broad fan-base through the stories they tell and the media they create, is the fan’s success as well (as value accrues to the IP assets over time)Fans as builders: IP assets in traditional media companies are tightly protected. However, PV wants to build alongside their fans, rather than treating them as customers and passive consumers of their media. For example, PV will let their fans contribute to stories, and also give full commercial rights to owners of some of their IP assets. Since fans are owners, they’re incentivised to help build with PVGFunk: We’re an IP business leveraging next generation technologies. We’re still approaching IP in a way that’s very similar to what these legacy institutions are doing, but we’re doing it in a way that actually benefits the broader community. This collective mind of our community all working together to develop this IP is going to be tremendously disruptive to legacy institutions. You’ve seen Amazon and Netflix already disrupt what the traditional studios were doing, and I think this is the next logical progression of where that’s going. (source: Comicman: The Exclusive Interview)​Make web3 funOne thing Pixel Vault has become renowned for, is gamifying the collector experience. For the nitty-gritty details of this, check out the Gamification section. Otherwise, just know this:PV wants each person’s collection of their assets to reflect their own decisions - based on their unique personality, personal preferences and risk appetite. Being one of their collectors is like being a part of the game that is Pixel Vault, orchestrated by GFunk and his team.This all stems from GFunk’s desire to create an active, engaged and fun collector experience:GFunk: At the end of the day, NFTs should be fun. If it's not bringing a smile to your face, you're doing something wrong (source: Every Punk has a story: GFunk and the PUNKS Comic | PROOF)​It’s a lot of - do you do Option 1 because of X & Y, or Option 2 because of Z. In the first instance, it may seem like one option is clearly better. But then there’s the game theory element. What if more people go with Option 2, does Option 1 start to become preferable? And then what if Option 3 is unexpectedly introduced?!Also, PV is thinking more broadly than just the collector experience. They want to make participating in the web3 ecosystem more fun and easy in general, for example, by gamifying DAO participation to incentivise engagement.Build web3 idea legos​Packy McCormick, who writes Not Boring, talks about the concept of idea legos. He argues that in web3, every new experiment is a building block for the future; a lego piece that anyone can pick up and use. Even if the things being built look silly or stupid, everything helps to compound human knowledge, enabling us to build faster & potentially solve more and more complex problems.Pixel Vault are constantly building new idea legos which solve problems within the space, and push the boundaries of what’s possible using web3 tech. These legos not only enable PV themselves to build faster and create new experiences, but it helps the broader space too.

What makes these special artistically and technologically is that each identity is generated at the time of mint. What does it mean to be generated at the time of mint?Every trait you see on a Generative is an individual image layer that’s been randomly combined together by an algorithm. That’s also how many other PFP NFT collections tend to create their assets too - however, the difference is in most cases, the artist will review the outputs of their algorithm, and curate the best of the best for the final collection. Being generated at the time of mint means that with the Generatives, there’s no human input. Given the image layers can be combined in basically an infinite number of ways, and you don’t want to end up with any weird layering errors, this is technically and artistically difficult to do.
